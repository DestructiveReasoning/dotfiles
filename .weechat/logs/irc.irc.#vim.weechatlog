2016-05-10 22:09:31	harwiltz	One more thing! Is there a way to change the way vim names its tabs? If I open another tab, it's title includes the entire path. For example, I have a tab called ~/A/P/a/s/m/j/c/w/d/o/Filename.java
2016-05-10 22:09:55	harwiltz	I guess it abbreviated the directory names to fit it in the tab. But that whole path isn't exactly useful to me

2016-05-10 22:14:53	MachinShin	i can't answer that, but i will say that at a minimum it seems to have forced a lot of forward momentum in vim
2016-05-10 22:16:13	Lepidopterist	i have heard that it pushed vim to give support for asynchronous scripts
2016-05-10 22:16:48	Lepidopterist	i'm a relatively new user to vim and will probably stick with it, if only for tendonitis issues. anyway, wondering if i should just use neovim or whether i should just wait
