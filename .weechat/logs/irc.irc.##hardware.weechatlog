2016-03-29 22:38:34	harwiltz	Hello all. Seemingly strange question: Are there any tools that you find make a job way harder than it has to be? Or just tools that are extremely annoying in general
2016-03-29 22:38:53	tx	what kind of tools
2016-03-29 22:38:59	ISmithers	Tools? Like, a glass hammer or bent saw?
2016-03-29 22:39:20	harwiltz	ISmithers: Anything
2016-03-29 22:39:30	harwiltz	But preferably some you can find in a store
2016-03-29 22:39:31	tx	too generic
2016-03-29 22:39:33	ikkuranus	a network wire jacket stripper
2016-03-29 22:39:36	tx	"a job" could also mean a lot
2016-03-29 22:39:47	ISmithers	I think you are thinking of a different kind of 'hardware' than this channel talks about.
2016-03-29 22:40:03	harwiltz	tx: I'm just looking for tools that are completely useless, but bent saw doesn't count because you can't find it in a store
2016-03-29 22:40:20	tx	I am sure you can
2016-03-29 22:40:22	tx	:P
2016-03-29 22:40:25	ikkuranus	as they often nic one or more conductors causing them to break
2016-03-29 22:40:26	harwiltz	ISmithers: Probably. I'm somewhat of a useless tool myself. But it doesn't have to be that kind of tools, just any tool in general
2016-03-29 22:40:42	tx	so software tools and real life tools?
2016-03-29 22:40:48	harwiltz	tx: Sure

2016-07-18 22:54:40	harwiltz	manirelli: No, it's mostly for programming and potentially CAD. I do some casual game dev but I don't need a crazy gpu
2016-07-18 22:54:50	auxy	look harwitz: what you should do is build yourself a nice Skylake PC using integrated graphics -- you will be blown away with how capable they are -- and then later when the market has settled a bit and the 1060 and RX 470 are out you can pick up a nice finFET GPU
2016-07-18 22:54:53	manirelli	if you are doing dev work, i wouldnt mess with a K or OC
2016-07-18 22:54:54	harwiltz	auxy: I basically only kept it there because there's no 4gb RX480 yet
2016-07-18 22:54:59	manirelli	you can easily chop money off there
2016-07-18 22:55:07	manirelli	shit, if you are competent you could even head over to xeon

2016-07-18 22:55:23	manirelli	easy
2016-07-18 22:55:28	auxy	not really
2016-07-18 22:55:32	manirelli	in CA?
2016-07-18 22:55:35	auxy	because skylake xeons won't run on Z170 boards
2016-07-18 22:55:36	harwiltz	The xeon didn't have that much in savings
2016-07-18 22:55:38	auxy	so you have to buy a Xeon board
2016-07-18 22:55:39	manirelli	oh
2016-07-18 22:55:42	manirelli	two dif things
2016-07-18 22:55:42	auxy	which is priceier

2016-07-18 22:55:55	harwiltz	auxy: I would easily go for a i7-6700, but that only has a freq of 3.4GHz

2016-07-18 22:56:58	auxy	nevermind the high-end MLC SATA SSDs
2016-07-18 22:57:01	harwiltz	Here comes the stupidity again... but what's involved in turboing?
2016-07-18 22:57:07	auxy	harwiltz: literally nothing
2016-07-18 22:57:10	manirelli	essentially auto-oc

2016-07-18 22:57:17	manirelli	downclock to powersave
2016-07-18 22:57:20	harwiltz	Does it reduce the lifespan of the cpu?
2016-07-18 22:57:23	auxy	the CPU will scale up its clock rate on demand
2016-07-18 22:57:24	auxy	no.
2016-07-18 22:57:29	auxy	it's a built-in feature not related to overclocking
2016-07-18 22:57:35	auxy	I don't like when people call it "OC" because it's not
2016-07-18 22:57:35	harwiltz	So what's the catch? I guess more heat?
2016-07-18 22:57:38	manirelli	auxy it shows ~30s at max difference
2016-07-18 22:57:39	auxy	there is no catch

2016-07-18 22:57:51	manirelli	mmmk
2016-07-18 22:57:53	harwiltz	So why isn't it turbo'd by default?
2016-07-18 22:58:02	auxy	[21:55:30] <auxy> it's an automatic CPU feature enabled by default
2016-07-18 22:58:07	manirelli	power saving
2016-07-18 22:58:11	harwiltz	Oh
2016-07-18 22:58:19	harwiltz	Ok nice. Lemme try one with that
2016-07-18 22:58:20	manirelli	lower heat, lower noise
2016-07-18 22:58:38	Varden	basically, when the power and thermal envelope allows a higher clock on one or more cores, it does so
2016-07-18 22:58:45	manirelli	that was on file copy auxy
2016-07-18 22:58:51	manirelli	everything else it literally inside 3s
2016-07-18 22:58:58	auxy	what's your point?
2016-07-18 22:59:05	manirelli	real world > synth
2016-07-18 22:59:09	auxy	sure
2016-07-18 22:59:13	auxy	and the real world tests show huge, huge gains
2016-07-18 22:59:14	manirelli	dont spend more on sata based ssds
2016-07-18 22:59:16	manirelli	its not worth it
2016-07-18 22:59:20	auxy	between products that are ludicrously similar
2016-07-18 22:59:30	auxy	so your link works against you, and your point is wrong
2016-07-18 22:59:39	auxy	Varden: the real problem with the SSD Plus is that it has no DRAM
2016-07-18 23:00:42	auxy	I'm really not a fan
2016-07-18 23:00:48	Varden	yeah I knew that much. cheap though, and for pcs that spend almost their entire lives running a tiny program that accesses a database on a server elsewhere, they do just fine
2016-07-18 23:00:50	auxy	I'd recommend the X400 over teh SSD PLUS, even though it uses TLC

2016-07-18 23:31:21	auxy	REALLY
2016-07-18 23:31:30	auxy	the GeIL should be fine, because Skylake supports DDR3L

2016-07-18 23:32:45	auxy	yeah, but it sucks
2016-07-18 23:32:48	Varden	Does speed matter more with ddr4 than it did with ddr3? I've never bothered with anything more than 1600 (never overclocked, no APUs)
2016-07-18 23:32:51	auxy	especially since cheap 2133 has high CL, like 15
2016-07-18 23:33:07	Harlock	i think i got cl13
2016-07-18 23:33:13	harwiltz	auxy: And the stock CPU cooler for the 6700 should be ok right?
2016-07-18 23:33:24	auxy	Varden: the problem is that you only see a few FPS difference in average FPS, so everyone says "meh RAM speed doesn't matter", but it's a real difference in subjective performance and percieved smoothness, and this is borne out by frametime metrics
2016-07-18 23:33:46	auxy	Varden: DigitalFoundry found that doing from 2133 to 2666 was a larger improvement on a Core i5-6500 than overclocking the CPU (using base clock) to 4GHz

2016-07-18 23:36:37	auxy	RAM overclocking is annoying

2016-07-19 15:03:47	lynorian	opengl is for gpu
2016-07-19 15:03:49	auxy	when we say "OpenGL rendering" are you talking about real-time rendering using a graphics processor or processors?
2016-07-19 15:03:57	auxy	or are you talking about offline (non-real-time) rendering using CPUs
2016-07-19 15:04:13	lynorian	or llvmpipe?

2016-07-19 17:05:29	Arv3n	I guess because it's being throttled so much? I'm not sure.
2016-07-19 17:05:49	JordiGH	Or your sensors are way wrong. No amount of throttling or fanning can bring it below temperature.

2016-07-19 17:21:04	applegal	Hey , that case came with two 92 mm fan intake at front.. would it improve airflow if I add another intake fan underneath the case? the distance are very close to the front fan like less than 1 cm apart.

2016-07-19 17:21:43	applegal	so it's like 2 fan intake and the underneath fan will blow up the front intake fan
2016-07-19 17:22:06	sirsquishy1	applegal, you never intake up from the ground

2016-07-19 17:22:10	faugusztin	applegal: on the picture above, i had no fan on the CPU heatsink itself, and the CPU was maxing out around 65-70C after 15 minutes of OCCT !
2016-07-19 17:22:10	Arv3n	auxy, maybe it's the power supply? I can only guess.
2016-07-19 17:22:13	sirsquishy1	you exhaust down
2016-07-19 17:22:49	faugusztin	applegal: then stop thinking about stupid ideas :). 99% you will be fine just with the back 14cm fan, in case of higher hard drive temps use the front 9.2cm fan(s)

2016-07-30 13:44:23	auxy	the real difference is the TDP
2016-07-30 13:44:31	wadawalnut	What's that?
2016-07-30 13:44:35	auxy	thermal design power
2016-07-30 13:44:43	auxy	basically, how much heat the chip is "allowed" to produce
2016-07-30 13:44:49	wadawalnut	Ok, right
2016-07-30 13:44:52	auxy	the Core i7-6700 will start throttling if it exceeds its TDP of 65W
2016-07-30 13:44:53	auxy	but
2016-07-30 13:45:03	auxy	the Core i7-6700K has only a "nominal" TDP of 91W

2016-07-30 13:45:11	auxy	K-series CPUs do not power throttle

2016-07-30 13:59:29	RightReasonRhyme	dreamcat4, that is because "color" is a valid spelling in a recognized dialect of English. You are just plain /wrong/.
2016-07-30 13:59:48	user123321	SSD*, sorry.
2016-07-30 14:00:05	auxy	yeah, historically it meant "anything"

2016-07-30 14:00:47	faugusztin	user123321: yes, it does affect life. SSDs are rated usualy for ~72TB lifetime writes, most can survive few hundred TB of writes

2016-07-30 14:00:57	anunnaki	hello, so I went to change some options in the GCC compiler -march option to update it for my i6700k Skylake processor.. and wanted to verify that i do use -march=skylake.. I saw intel now calls Skylake, Ark? is this true?
2016-07-30 14:01:02	dreamcat4	turns out i'm wrong this time

2016-07-30 14:01:31	user123321	faugusztin, Yes, so such software bugs are pretty scary. Is there anything I could do about such bugs?

2016-07-30 14:37:52	XLV	es1, yeah it only has vga... try to reset cmos to have bios load defaults again
2016-07-30 14:38:09	XLV	quite weird the gpu shows no video, there could be more at play here

2016-07-30 14:39:06	es1	yes very weird
2016-07-30 14:39:27	XLV	ScRaMbLe, skylake supports dmi 3.0 which is 4x v3 pcie bw rated.. while haswell only dmi 2.0 which is 4x v2 pcie bw
2016-07-30 14:40:08	XLV	ScRaMbLe, so if you have an ssd attached to IOH's pcie than haswell doesnt have enough bw between cpu and IOH to support a pcie v3 4x ssd
2016-07-30 14:40:27	XLV	also, z87/97 chipsets only have pcie v2 lanes
2016-07-30 14:40:40	es1	is there a way i can fix this
2016-07-30 14:40:51	es1	without buying vga cable and monitor? lol
2016-07-30 14:41:04	XLV	so it would take all the 8 lanes they got to support only one 4x pcie v3 ssd and a pcie bridge to transform 8 v2 lanes to 4 v3 lanes

2016-07-30 14:41:10	XLV	es1, try the cmos reset
2016-07-30 14:41:25	XLV	es1, and open the system and check all cables and connections, in gpu/dimms etc

2016-07-30 14:42:08	es1	cmos reset?
2016-07-30 14:42:10	es1	how?
2016-07-30 14:42:10	XLV	ScRaMbLe, if the ssd is connected via cpu lanes then theres no difference but then you'd have to have gpu to pcie 8x
2016-07-30 14:42:20	XLV	es1, its a little jumper on mb, consult your manual
2016-07-30 14:42:41	XLV	es1, you set it to reset position for a minute or two, then return it to normal position and power up the system

2016-07-30 14:43:22	es1	but arent they already on default?
2016-07-30 14:43:29	XLV	ScRaMbLe, not a big difference but then you lose option to have sli/xfire
2016-07-30 14:43:29	es1	causin issue?
2016-07-30 14:43:59	XLV	es1, perhaps there are just corrupted values after cmos battery crapped out, so do the cmos reset to be certain
2016-07-30 14:44:10	ScRaMbLe	XLV gotcha, for full potential on all fronts, skylake is needed, ty

2016-07-30 14:46:15	XLV	es1, you need to get some bios picture to do some troubleshooting, it may be something more grave like psu problem

2016-07-30 15:11:51	dreamcat4	es1: you may take out the battery, and then short the 2 pins in the battery holder with a screwdriver, which is another way can clear the cmos

2016-07-30 15:36:22	es1	sorry i dont know what's a jumper
2016-07-30 15:36:27	Walex	stakewinner00: CPU fans and cases are difficult to choose because it is not totally obvious what is "best".
2016-07-30 15:36:40	XLV	its a little plastic cap that bridges two header pins
2016-07-30 15:37:03	XLV	you remove it from the normal position, and move it one pin upwards to bridge the reset position

2016-07-30 15:37:50	dreamcat4	XLV: i'm assuming when they put HBM on the cpu / APU, it will reduce the pin count. as currently many of those pins go off to connect to the DIMM slots

2016-07-30 15:39:53	auxy	what I want to know is
2016-07-30 15:39:57	auxy	what about scheduling?
2016-07-30 15:40:10	auxy	having heterogeneous computing like that (with a mixture of Xeon Skylake and Xeon Phi processors) is new
2016-07-30 15:40:20	dreamcat4	XLV: i mean the HBM can exist in the same package or MCM as the cpu / apu... it doesnt need a separate chip
2016-07-30 15:40:21	XLV	SorcererX, yeah... add to that the new nand intel and micron are producing, that would be an inbetween dram and nand storage via pcie or sata/sas..
2016-07-30 15:40:24	auxy	so is Windows for example going to be clever enough to keep most tasks to the Skylake chips?
2016-07-30 15:40:29	Walex	stakewinner00: if you wait a bit I'll give you more details, and if you tell me what kind of PC you want to buy I can scan in the relevant page
2016-07-30 15:40:36	dreamcat4	fewer socket pins
2016-07-30 15:40:55	XLV	dreamcat4, sure but then the mem config is set, not expandable.. i am talking about being able to add mem chips into an hbm cpu package
2016-07-30 15:41:03	dreamcat4	yeah it would have to be
2016-07-30 15:41:17	XLV	with zif sockets... so you can have several mem configs.. and with each mem chip added, the mem bus width increasing
2016-07-30 15:41:29	dreamcat4	it would make sense for notebooks at least

2016-07-30 15:43:31	XLV	it sure would make sense in some configs but people are used to being able to expand their systems' ram.. especially in enthusiasts/workstation/server market.. then again, it would be an added venue for intel to flood the market with 10 times more SKUs.. this time separated by ram amount
2016-07-30 15:43:36	Walex	as an example someone has put here a 2 year old copyof Custom PC UK: http://www.kopineeyang.com/wp-content/uploads/yumpu_files/Custom%20PC%20UK%202014-09.pdf and the suggested part lists are around page 70-75
2016-07-30 15:43:58	XLV	even better for intel too.. if you wanna increase ram you gotta change whole cpu module.. more money for them
2016-07-30 15:44:14	XLV	but it could be done the way i describe offering some expandability
2016-07-30 15:44:38	auxy	I don't think you can install HBM via socket
2016-07-30 15:44:41	auxy	due to the construction
2016-07-30 15:44:48	dreamcat4	XLV: yeah maybe DDR4 is cheaper so people will continue with it for regular boards for a long time and HBM will only be widely used in space-critical applications
2016-07-30 15:44:48	auxy	it has to connect to multiple layers of the silicon its passing through

2016-07-30 15:45:59	stakewinner00	Walex, interesting, the processor that i will buy is AMD FX-6300 Six-Core 3.5GHZ, i compile a lot of things in my every day, so i'm a little bit worried about overheating
2016-07-30 15:46:01	Walex	for CPU fans I prefer smaller than bigger and easier to mount
2016-07-30 15:46:08	XLV	auxy, the socket would be connected to the interposer, then you just install the mem chip in the socket
2016-07-30 15:46:24	Walex	stakewinner00: I wrote a post about my current configuration here:
2016-07-30 15:46:25	dreamcat4	its an interesting idea, sure
2016-07-30 15:46:27	auxy	hmm
2016-07-30 15:46:33	auxy	well, maybe!
2016-07-30 15:46:34	SorcererX	for fans I prefer them as large as possible really
2016-07-30 15:46:37	XLV	and about scheduling, thats why all those efforts to have cpus/gpus use same data sets in mem and using similar async scheduling
2016-07-30 15:46:42	dreamcat4	for example if you buy an intel cpu, its already on a little PCB of its own
2016-07-30 15:47:05	dreamcat4	quite the engineering challenge

2016-07-30 16:03:05	Walex	NVME IIRC is just a protocol to do IO over PCIe instead of over a SATA cable.

2016-07-30 16:11:20	wadawalnut	auxy: In one of my courses last semester we had to make a program that solves a puzzle invented by my prof. I ended up making this data structure that used an obscene amount of RAM (basically an enormous array of bytes that I could do bit operations on) but it did add and search fuckin fast. THe program wouldn't even run on my friends laptop because it used more than 4G RAM. Mine was the fastest in the

2016-07-30 16:17:18	auxy	I remember reading about that in the past
2016-07-30 16:17:38	auxy	about how speed and capacity are sort of two sides of the same coin
2016-07-30 16:17:46	auxy	specifically this was with regard to game development
2016-07-30 16:17:55	Calinou	modern programs tend to favor eating RAM over saving it and wasting CPU
2016-07-30 16:18:00	SorcererX	as for professor, the majority of professors in US/CA wouldn't be professors in europe, they'd have a different academic title (lower rank).. always confusing for me
2016-07-30 16:18:03	auxy	basically in game development you can make your game huge and pre-compute everything or you can make your game really small and compute everything at runtime
2016-07-30 16:18:03	Calinou	which is arguably a Good Thing™
2016-07-30 16:18:21	auxy	and I guess that sort of applies to general app development
2016-07-30 16:18:46	SorcererX	auxy: I remember some tiny 64K scene demos that would compute everything runtime, fun stuff
2016-07-30 16:18:49	MrSparkle	chrome's ram usage is a good thing
2016-07-30 16:18:51	Walex	bah! my question is... to get a ballpark estimate of the cost of a server, what kind of USA based site has good a reasonable server-configurator that gives semi-reliable pricing?

2016-08-12 15:40:23	Calinou	some Gigabytes are crap, some are great
2016-08-12 15:40:38	Calinou	this one is ok - it's /too/ cooled, which means it'll never go above ~72°C or so, but it'll be noisier than usual at load

2016-08-12 19:50:50	Calinou	but also fairly expensive
2016-08-12 19:50:53	jookiyaya	calinou you own be quiet cooler? which one?
2016-08-12 19:50:59	BobSacamano	That's the thing. I'm already over budget
2016-08-12 19:50:59	Calinou	yeah
2016-08-12 19:51:09	Calinou	then go for Hyper 212 EVO or whatever
2016-08-12 19:51:12	Calinou	it's like €30 here
2016-08-12 19:51:14	jookiyaya	calinou pro or regular
2016-08-12 19:51:17	BobSacamano	It's $40 here
2016-08-12 19:51:17	Calinou	regular

2016-08-12 19:52:00	XLV	BobSacamano, for a mild oc, the t2 should be enough but not much more than that, its rated to 130W tdp and only two heapipes, 92mm fan

2016-08-13 12:10:20	modp	is your cable a straight HDMI cable? or is it DVI on one end and HDMI on the other?
2016-08-13 12:10:31	harwiltz	modp: DVI and HDMI
2016-08-13 12:10:46	modp	ok, so plug the HDMI end into your vid card and the DVI into your monitor

2016-08-13 12:22:07	Hulio	anyone?
2016-08-13 12:22:08	Beelsebob	why does it matter Aldem ?  What's the problem?
2016-08-13 12:22:13	Hulio	double DIN
2016-08-13 12:22:29	Hulio	is it good for android OS for car stereo system?
2016-08-13 12:22:40	Beelsebob	Hulio: only one feature is important in a car stereo these days - CarPlay or Android Auto
2016-08-13 12:23:28	Aldem	I have this switch on my modo, it says EZ_XMP, the manual just says enable this switch to enable oc on the ram, but is the XMP profile considered an OC ?
2016-08-13 12:24:02	Hulio	does it have GPS?
2016-08-13 12:24:35	Beelsebob	Hulio: CarPlay definately has built in navigation, using your phone's GPS - I assume Android Auto has the same feature
2016-08-13 12:24:50	Hulio	so i need my phone to have GPS?
2016-08-13 12:24:54	Hulio	nah, i dont like the idea
2016-08-13 12:25:28	Hulio	if i use the phne, then i just use phone GPS then, no need stereo
2016-08-13 12:25:34	Hulio	doesn't make any sense
2016-08-13 12:26:08	Beelsebob	Hulio: the whole point of CarPlay and Android Auto is to give you an actually good quality car stereo, by making your phone do all the work, rather than having $random_stereo_manufacturer do a shit job of the software
2016-08-13 12:26:25	Beelsebob	because every single car manufacturer and car stereo manufacturer SUCKS
2016-08-13 12:26:58	Beelsebob	for reference - typically, a GPS is not a feature of a stereo, it's a feature of the car, that's wired into the stereo... The stereo is too much in a faraday cage to get a good signal
2016-08-13 12:27:04	Hulio	but the GPS thru phone is suck
2016-08-13 12:27:18	Hulio	imagine i dont have a phone....that my car stereo suck
2016-08-13 12:28:10	Beelsebob	then, you have no choice but to buy into any one of a number of shitty bits of software on overpriced hardware
2016-08-13 12:28:11	Beelsebob	\o/
2016-08-13 12:28:43	Hulio	well, i stick with OEM GPS :)

2016-08-17 20:11:07	sirsquishy1	such as TLC has a lot more limited write cycles then MLC has

2016-08-17 20:13:40	sirsquishy1	for TLC is something like 20,000-30,000 write options

2016-08-18 11:36:55	Calinou	talking about the system UEFI, yeah
2016-08-18 11:36:58	Calinou	which replaced BIOS since 2012
2016-08-18 11:37:16	harwiltz	Calinou: So you're saying its built into the motherboard basically

2016-08-18 11:39:33	Calinou	download an ISO, put it on the USB drive - you can get the ISO legally from Microsoft's site
2016-08-18 11:39:43	Calinou	it needs to be the same edition and bitness as the one shipped with your laptop

2016-08-18 11:43:06	harwiltz	One more question guys. I'm building a computer, and I bought some parts that have mail-in rebates. I just received one of them, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to mail in. What should I be looking for?
2016-08-18 11:43:29	harwiltz	steevo: It's new enough to come with windows 10, so I'm imagining it has UEFI
2016-08-18 11:44:37	cousteau	hmm ok, so someone http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-2453160/cable-resolution-refresh-rate-limitations.html says that VGA works at up to 1920x1080, 70 Hz... so I guess it's safe to spit 66Hz there :)

2016-08-18 11:44:54	cousteau	(probably higher res with lower freq can be achieved as well)
2016-08-18 11:45:04	steevo	harwiltz, mail-in rebates are usually manufacturer-specific. but usually you just need to send in a copy of your receipt and the bar code from the box
2016-08-18 11:45:38	harwiltz	steevo: Ok nice. Because I'm seeing something on the box that says the warranty will be void if removed, I was worried that's what I have to send
2016-08-18 11:45:49	harwiltz	And how do I know which address to send it to?
2016-08-18 11:46:48	steevo	harwiltz: yeah, it's pretty much a sure thing you don't need to send that. I do advise that you look up the manufacturers instructions, and follow them to the letter though
2016-08-18 11:47:00	cousteau	...and well, someone at http://superuser.com/questions/205453/maximum-resolution-through-vga-dvi-hdmi-etc said that 2048x1536px @85 Hz

2016-08-23 13:13:40	harwiltz	Hey guys. I'm building a pc soon and I bought a PCI wifi adapter because my new pc won't be near any ethernet cables. However, I just realized that I have a ethernet bridge at home. Will the ethernet bridge perform better than the wifi adapter?

2016-08-23 13:15:32	harwiltz	Kevin`: Ok. So do you reccommend that I return my wifi adapter? 
2016-08-23 13:15:36	harwiltz	*recommend
2016-08-23 13:15:39	Kevin`	I would test both
2016-08-23 13:15:56	Kevin`	if the pci card does not have a cabled antenna, the case can interfere with it

2016-08-24 16:53:05	harwiltz	Hi guys. I'm building a pc now, and I'm having trouble connecting the 24-pin cable to the motherboard. I'm pushing down really hard on it, but the clip won't clip on. It seems like it's pushed in all the way, but the clip isn't really over the tab. I'm trying to pull it out but it's really hard to remove.

2016-08-24 16:54:36	BustyLoli-Chan	I mean they are all shaped a certain way so that it's pretty close to impossible to push the 24 pin in incorrectly
2016-08-24 16:54:37	harwiltz	BustyLoli-Chan: Yeah, looks like they do

2016-08-24 16:55:40	modp	its just a bad fit...happens time to time. rock the connector back and forth as you push down, and pull back on the top of the clip to try to see if the bottom will slip over the notch
2016-08-24 16:55:45	BustyLoli-Chan	the board or the power supply could be slightly imperfect in just the right way so the clips don't lock lol
2016-08-24 16:55:49	harwiltz	BustyLoli-Chan: Would it help if I upload a pic? I took a picture but it's very hard to see the clip

2016-08-24 23:05:03	harwiltz	Hey guys. I just built a pc with a intel i7-6700k and a hyper 212 evo. I'm getting idle temperature of 50C. Seems way too high. Is this abnormal?
2016-08-24 23:06:09	harwiltz	The fans are pretty loud too.
2016-08-24 23:06:16	modp	yeah, thats too high for an evo 212 and idle
2016-08-24 23:06:34	harwiltz	modp: What did I do wrong?
2016-08-24 23:06:47	modp	you sure it's mounted properly? right amount of thermal paste?
2016-08-24 23:06:59	harwiltz	I think I definitely put enough thermal paste... It was more than a grain of rice
2016-08-24 23:07:21	harwiltz	Otherwise, it feels like the mount was tightened all the way
2016-08-24 23:07:24	modp	cleaned the top of the processor beforehand?
2016-08-24 23:07:32	modp	well i guess its a new build
2016-08-24 23:07:38	modp	so thats fine
2016-08-24 23:08:16	modp	when you say idle, do you mean in the OS with the task manager showing no load? or are you looking at the temp in the bios/uefi?
