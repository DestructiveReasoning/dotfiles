2016-05-10 20:25:19	harwiltz	Hey guys. I'm having some trouble with NERDTree in vim, but #vim wasn't helpful. For some reason, I can't open any files in nerdtree. I can expand directories though. Any idea why this is happening?

2016-08-05 15:40:40	jim	zerous, ok... some dists turn off the tcp listener of the running *dm, maybe it did for you too... you'll need to check. also, to "xdmcp" into that machine, you'd need an x server on the machine you're going to be connecting from
