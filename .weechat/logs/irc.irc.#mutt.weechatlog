2016-08-17 17:19:42	harwiltz	Hello everyone. I have configured my muttrc and mailcap to automatically display HTML emails in links. However, when it does this, I cannot click the hyperlinks. So I further configured it to allow me to open the emails in chromium, by hitting v to view the attachment, followed by m to check the mailcap.

2016-08-17 17:20:47	harwiltz	I would like to make a shortcut for this, but I don't know how. For example, if it were vim I would do nmap z vm
2016-08-17 17:20:56	harwiltz	What is the mutt equivalent of this?
