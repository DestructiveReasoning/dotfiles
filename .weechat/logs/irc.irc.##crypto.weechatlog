2016-08-03 17:15:00	harwiltz	Hey guys. I recently became interested in crypto after reading a bit about it in my Linear Algebra textbook. Just wanted to know, what do you guys use crypto for? If I plan on learning it, how can I expect to use my knowledge?
2016-08-03 17:17:13	Alipha	um, secure communication (e.g., HTTPS), encrypting files/drives, storing passwords, blockchains (e.g., bitcoin)...

2016-08-03 17:20:18	eightyeight	TLS is the main use, ubiquitously
2016-08-03 17:20:59	harwiltz	Ok, but stuff like HTTPS and bitcoin, as well as the encryption schemes for my files have already been written. I understand that crypto is needed to improve those things, but as a learning cryptographer, how can I apply my knowledge?
2016-08-03 17:21:18	harwiltz	eightyeight: Excuse my idiocy, what's TLS?
2016-08-03 17:21:50	eightyeight	transport layer security. it's the protocol attached to HTTP to give HTTPS; IMAP to give IMAPS, etc., etc., etc.
2016-08-03 17:22:03	harwiltz	eightyeight: Oh, ok. Thanks

2016-08-03 17:25:39	harwiltz	Alipha: I appreciate that. But before I get a job, is learning crypto entirely theoretical?

2016-08-03 17:30:37	Alipha	harwiltz: depends upon if you want to pursue the mathematical side of crypto or the applicable side of crypto. Companies need security people who know how to apply crypto correctly. The mathematical side would be more developing new algorithms or breaking existing ones, which is a much narrower field

2016-08-03 17:38:43	Alipha	harwiltz: a computer programmer can apply crypto to create software without any advance math classes or giving a shit about how the algorithms work internally. They just need to know that to do X, they use A, B, and C and not do D or E. Knowing some of the theory will help then understand why you do A, B, and C but not D or E, but that's not completely necessary
