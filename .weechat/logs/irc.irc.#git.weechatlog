2016-03-31 23:01:26	harwiltz	Hey guys. I made a repo and recently someone forked it. I need to delete commits I've made, and I've managed to delete them from my repo, but they still show up on the forked repo. Is it possible to remove those as well?
2016-03-31 23:02:20	preaction	no
2016-03-31 23:02:52	+Eugene	Nope. The forker would need to follow the advice in !rewrite
2016-03-31 23:02:52	@gitinfo	Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum
2016-03-31 23:03:05	preaction	well, you can ask nicely. you can also, depending on the situation, ask not-so-nicely

2016-03-31 23:04:18	harwiltz	this git push --force-with-lease basically syncs my repo with his if he accepts?

2016-03-31 23:07:04	preaction	the point being is you absolutely cannot do anything with someone else's repository unless they want you to, so you should likely modify your wants

2016-03-31 23:08:37	harwiltz	The only thing is, I decided to give credit to my prof for the assignment in the README, but seeing as that no one knows my github I decided to give him a funny nickname (not insulting). I don't really want him to see it though

2016-03-31 23:32:35	harwiltz	Well I can change my name on github for now. I have my name written in the code once
2016-03-31 23:33:00	harwiltz	But it will be fairly hard for the prof to find it and blame me for anything if I delete my repo I would think
2016-03-31 23:33:13	harwiltz	Especially since he isn't familiar with github
2016-03-31 23:33:38	harwiltz	He probably doesn't even know it's on github/probably doesn't remember the name github
2016-03-31 23:33:54	preaction	i'm sensing you have a deep admiration and respect for your professor
