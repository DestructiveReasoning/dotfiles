2016-02-09 15:47:56	harwiltz	Hello. I'm trying to write a base converter program in C but I'm having issues parsing large inputs. I'm using unsigned long long int and it won't parse numbers with 10 or more digits.

2016-02-09 15:50:33	harwiltz	twkm, I really don't think the logic is flawed. I'm manually converting the string to an unsigned long long int, and I print out every multiplication necessary to do so
2016-02-09 15:50:36	jalt	look into the error and the man page for strtoll: http://linux.die.net/man/3/strtol
2016-02-09 15:50:37	@candide	Title of jalt's link: strtol(3): convert string to long integer - Linux man page
2016-02-09 15:50:42	twkm	besides, ULLONG_MAX would be the relevant macro.
2016-02-09 15:50:44	harwiltz	The one that screws up is a 10 digit number
2016-02-09 15:51:04	harwiltz	twkm, yes, and ULLONG_MAX is way greater than 10 digits long
2016-02-09 15:51:09	twkm	harwiltz: you would be converting every digit else just use strtoull.

2016-02-09 15:53:48	twkm	*shrug*  you aren't sharing even a statement much less a test case.  do you expect we can read your mind?
2016-02-09 15:54:14	twkm	however, i'll guess that it is your printf that sucks.
2016-02-09 15:54:29	harwiltz	Ok, I have this:
2016-02-09 15:54:48	harwiltz	printf("%d\n",strtoull("9999999999",0,10));
2016-02-09 15:55:01	harwiltz	The code I thought was clear enough to not need to share a snippet
2016-02-09 15:55:02	twkm	yup, you fucked up the printf.
2016-02-09 15:55:15	harwiltz	I guess I shouldn't be using %d...
2016-02-09 15:55:21	harwiltz	yup I'm a dumbass
2016-02-09 15:55:27	jalt	%d is for int, which will be 32bit on your system, which cannot hold your 999 value
2016-02-09 15:55:43	twkm	feh.  ignore the assertion as to size.
2016-02-09 15:56:11	jalt	i am right because he told me he got 1410065407 before
2016-02-09 15:56:21	twkm	immaterial.
2016-02-09 15:56:34	DHex	Hi
2016-02-09 15:56:43	harwiltz	Wait but even with %u I get the same thing
2016-02-09 15:56:52	Arch-TK	that's unsigned
2016-02-09 15:56:53	crahan_	typedef struct bigNumber { char digit[1000]; }  , 1 digit per cas
2016-02-09 15:56:53	jalt	%llu
2016-02-09 15:56:54	twkm	you don't read the docs very well harwiltz.
2016-02-09 15:56:58	Arch-TK	strtoull returns unsigned long long
2016-02-09 15:57:08	harwiltz	I didn't see a %llu on the page I'm on
2016-02-09 15:57:16	twkm	printf expects int due the %d, but the type of the argument is unsigned long long, so harwiltz has undefined behavior not "cannot hold your value".
2016-02-09 15:57:21	jalt	no, you should see u and ll as a modifier
2016-02-09 15:57:22	twkm	*READ* the page.
2016-02-09 15:57:26	Arch-TK	harwiltz: that's because l is a length modifier

2016-02-14 12:34:32	cousteau	jackcom, what is ++argv?
2016-02-14 12:34:50	jackcom	*++argv cousteau
2016-02-14 12:35:01	cousteau	yes, I didn't ask about that.  What is ++argv?
2016-02-14 12:35:11	jackcom	oh
2016-02-14 12:35:21	cousteau	(it's a bit complicated, since argv is a pointer)
2016-02-14 12:36:04	jackcom	argv is pointer
2016-02-14 12:36:13	cousteau	so ++argv is...?
2016-02-14 12:36:20	M4GNV5	jackcom, its like argv = argv + 1; *argv; in one step
2016-02-14 12:36:27	jackcom	yeah i know
2016-02-14 12:36:37	jackcom	then what is type of argv?
2016-02-14 12:36:47	jokoon	I have a void* which I want to decompress to a char array using zlib, cam somebody explain to me how to do it, because the zlib_how.html has 2 do nested loop and I don't understand everything
2016-02-14 12:36:47	Learath2	M4GNV5, foo(args[0],args[1],args[2]) ? or void foo(int args[]) ?
2016-02-14 12:37:03	cousteau	jackcom, the function prototype of main() almost says it
2016-02-14 12:37:10	cousteau	it's a char **
2016-02-14 12:37:19	jackcom	oh
2016-02-14 12:37:29	Learath2	or do you not know the number of arguments
2016-02-14 12:37:38	jackcom	char *argv[]  == char **?
2016-02-14 12:37:45	M4GNV5	Learath2, i only have the length of args in an integer and foo as a void* from dlsym
2016-02-14 12:37:57	cousteau	jackcom, only because it's a parameter declaration
2016-02-14 12:38:33	cousteau	functions can't take arrays as arguments, so when you do void foo(int x[]) you're actually doing void foo(int *x)

2016-02-14 12:39:30	jackcom	foo(int x[])  x is pointer instead of array?
2016-02-14 12:39:38	cousteau	(NB: functions can take pointers to arrays, so void foo(int x[3][3]) is not the same as void foo(int **x))
2016-02-14 12:39:43	cousteau	jackcom, yes
2016-02-14 12:40:27	cousteau	however if you declare an array like   int y[3];   then it's not the same as a pointer; this is an exceptional thing function parameter declaration allows
2016-02-14 12:40:33	jackcom	i don’t know why function can’t take arrays as arguments?

2016-02-14 12:42:21	cousteau	C passes arguments to functions by value, i.e. it evaluates whatever you use to call the function and passes a copy of the result of evaluating it.  However when you evaluate an array in C you don't get the whole array, but a pointer to the first element

2016-02-14 12:44:52	Aeroblop	I'm trying to implement a linked list queue, which has a pointer to the head of the list (for popping elements) and a pointer to the end of the list (for easy enqueueing).

2016-02-14 12:45:26	Aeroblop	I'd like to instantiate n queues, so far I simply have an array of head pointers and an array of end pointers
2016-02-14 12:45:33	guts	cousteau: Did you look at my code?
2016-02-14 12:45:47	Aeroblop	such that heads[6] would point to the head of the seventh queue.
2016-02-14 12:45:54	cousteau	guts, yes, but I didn't know what the problem was

2016-02-14 12:47:05	Aeroblop	I was just wondering what the best way to implement it into my program so I can have n queues. I was thinking of a function that just returns these two arrays of pointers, with an input int n. How would I go about doing this?
2016-02-14 12:47:40	cousteau	Aeroblop, I'd rather have an array of struct { head, tail } than 2 separate arrays
