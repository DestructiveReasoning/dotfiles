2016-08-23 17:13:08	harwiltz	I have a question about having multiple keys. Let's say I have my external drive and I give it the keyfile /etc/ext.key. Then I plug it into another computer that happens to have another file called /etc/ext.key for a different external drive. Will it block me from unlocking my drive on that computer because one of the passwords is wrong, or does it try all passwords until one is right?
