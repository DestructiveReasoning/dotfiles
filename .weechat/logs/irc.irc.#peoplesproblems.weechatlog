2016-02-15 19:49:19	BobSacamano	Now we started school at the same uni in september, and at orientation I hung out with her a lot. But at one of the dances, a friend of both of ours found out I like her, and while everyone was drunk he blatantly tried getting her to dance with me. She's kind of shy though so that probably made her pretty uncomfortable.
2016-02-15 19:49:30	WOWagain	Need some advice on the advice I've already been given. Need s wise older woman?

2016-02-15 19:49:55	BobSacamano	But she always initiates hugs with me. I know that sounds like nothing, but no one ever hugs me because I guess I have pretty bad social skills and never give off the right vibe. But she does.

2016-02-15 20:00:49	Impala	Hi
2016-02-15 20:00:51	d13	BobSacamano, i definitely understand. Your questions haven't been dumb. i've had to ask the same ones before, but i didn't have anyone to ask back then so i just decided not to text or talk to the girl. i was too insecure i guess, and i missed out, but You don't have to be a social veteran! Trust me, every conversation starts with something simple
2016-02-15 20:00:51	d13	and leads into bigger and better things. Just start with "Hi" if You have to, but don't give up before even trying
