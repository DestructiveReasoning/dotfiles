2016-06-23 13:03:22	sponix	are you looking for a small project or something smaller ?
2016-06-23 13:03:36	BobSacamano	Anything, really. 
2016-06-23 13:03:48	BobSacamano	Something that I can contribute to in a meaningful way
2016-06-23 13:04:24	sponix	With your coding skills there are TONS of projects
2016-06-23 13:05:01	BobSacamano	I know, that's the problem, I can't choose one!
2016-06-23 13:06:13	sponix	I'm partial to Linux Mint, ZoL (ZFS On Linux), FreeBSD, and Porno Films   :)
2016-06-23 13:07:12	BobSacamano	Hahahahaha
2016-06-23 13:07:28	BobSacamano	So you work on Linux mint and FreeBSD?
2016-06-23 13:07:44	BobSacamano	Or you contribute to software for them?
2016-06-23 13:10:50	sponix	Haven't done much with FreeBSD for a long time.. Just Installed it for a bit today though, it hasn't changed much since 2002 :)
2016-06-23 13:11:36	sponix	I'm not one to code much.. Most of what I do is just simple user Beta testing and reporting bugs and possible work-a-rounds if I find them
2016-06-23 13:11:45	BobSacamano	Yeah, I tried FreeBSD a little while ago. It's cool, but eventually I realized that I couldn't really tell the difference between it and Linux and I just preferred Arch
2016-06-23 13:12:31	sponix	I really should be on the Mint 18 Beta right now.. Just need another Drive in this box :P
2016-06-23 13:14:14	BobSacamano	Hahaha
2016-06-23 13:15:00	sponix	I Horde way to much Media.. Doesn't matter how many drives I pile in they are always Packed :(
2016-06-23 13:15:43	BobSacamano	Jesus. How big is your drive?
2016-06-23 13:15:58	sponix	Ha.. Drive.. Drive ?

2016-06-23 13:16:49	BobSacamano	That's... not small
2016-06-23 13:17:42	sponix	Yeah, I did a total earlier roughly 9.5TB of Drives with only like 2.5TB Free
2016-06-23 13:18:14	sponix	I want to replace my 5 x 1TB drives with a 5 x 5TB (or 6TB) setup  ;)
2016-06-23 13:18:50	sponix	I'm not employed at the moment and the bills are stacking up though.. SO my storage dreams are on hold   :P
2016-06-23 13:18:52	BobSacamano	Wtf do you hoard on there?
2016-06-23 13:19:07	sponix	I torrent the shit outta most everything
2016-06-23 13:19:50	BobSacamano	That's impressive
2016-06-23 13:24:18	sponix	rkeene knows his shit for sure, but he is WAY above my understanding on some things 
2016-06-23 13:29:46	BobSacamano	Me too, to say the least. Im pretty lost hahaha
2016-06-23 13:31:25	sponix	You haven't spent much time on *nix systems.. Have you ?
2016-06-23 13:32:23	BobSacamano	I've used Linux for about 3 years, that's about it. Not much networking or cloud experience
