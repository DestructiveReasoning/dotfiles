2016-08-03 17:47:02	BobSacamano	Hello all. I'm interested to learn how tools like aircrack-ng work. I'm not interested in using those tools, but more how I can build them myself. Is there anywhere I can learn stuff like that? I already know how to code.
2016-08-03 17:47:44	@riot	I think you misunderstand what this channel is about.
2016-08-03 17:48:01	@riot	Maybe the topic helps? ;)
2016-08-03 17:48:23	@riot	We're hackers developing maritime technology/stuff/source
2016-08-03 17:48:24	BobSacamano	riot: That's very possible. Do you know of another channel that's better suited for my inquiry?
2016-08-03 17:48:35	BobSacamano	riot: Oh. Definitely a misunderstanding
2016-08-03 17:48:40	@riot	hmm. Not sure. Did you check #aircrack ?
2016-08-03 17:48:56	BobSacamano	riot: Didn't even think of that, haha. I'll try
2016-08-03 17:49:01	BobSacamano	Sorry for the inconvenience
2016-08-03 17:49:06	@riot	But actually, having played with that before: why don't you just try it out? Not much you can break, except the law.. (careful with that)
2016-08-03 17:50:20	BobSacamano	I was planning on trying it on my own network. But I have no clue where to start programming-wise. I don't know how the attacks work
