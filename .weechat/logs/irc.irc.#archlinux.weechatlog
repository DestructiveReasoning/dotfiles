2015-09-12 18:36:00	d_garbage	BobSacamano, no, not at all
2015-09-12 18:36:14	Arch-TK	BobSacamano: some of them are most likely running IRC bouncers and most will likely be watching another channel.
2015-09-12 18:36:22	BobSacamano	d_garbage: ok then hahaha... makes sense. 
2015-09-12 18:36:30	BobSacamano	d_garbage: Thanks for clearing that up
2015-09-12 18:36:39	d_garbage	BobSacamano, many of the people logged in may well skim through their logs though, hard to say. I would imagine so or otherwise why bother?
2015-09-12 18:36:41	Halfwit	ironicaldiction: Hm. I use startx, with a call to exec i3 in my xinitrc (you have a call to backlight in yours); and that works for me. I'll check a few more of your logs here to see what's going on though
2015-09-12 18:36:53	BobSacamano	Arch-TK: that makes sense too. Thans
2015-09-12 18:36:55	BobSacamano	*thanks
2015-09-12 18:36:58	Arch-TK	as in, most of them are probably either looking at another channel, are away from their computer, are not connected to their server which is running their irc client, or are not connected to their bouncer.

2015-11-06 22:42:26	Foxhoundz	That's not true, demize. From what I've read, there are certain systemd related processes that can cause complete system instability if it crashes
2015-11-06 22:42:47	Foxhoundz	And I would kindly ask you tone down your hostile stance against me.

2016-02-14 20:35:50	hdanak	Hi, I've been getting fairly frequent system freezes (can't switch to vt's), I'm wondering if someone might have some advice for how to diagnose the issue (I'm on a ThinkPad T430 btw)?
2016-02-14 20:36:16	hdanak	might be hardware issues, but not sure
2016-02-14 20:36:22	hdanak	no obvious sign of kernel panics
2016-02-14 20:36:26	polyzen	well, last time that happened to me was when i rewound something i was streaming via sshfs

2016-02-14 20:37:14	harwiltz	Do you guys know if ncmpcpp can play flac files?
2016-02-14 20:37:20	hdanak	saptech: right
2016-02-14 20:37:21	Halfwit	harwiltz: Basically, you fork a repo - meaning that anything you do to it (changes you make, stuff you release) will be on your specific branch. If you wish to help the devs, you'd fork their work, implement your changes, and do something called a pull request, to include your changes into the main program. Else, you just keep on your own branch, making all your changes 
2016-02-14 20:37:21	[_]b	it can
2016-02-14 20:37:25	polyzen	i think my hangs are from my gpu driver

2016-03-26 12:39:47	grawity	because the archiso is also old
2016-03-26 12:39:50	eviladmin	sadly arch is not legally  allowed to distribute the broadcom driver

2016-04-30 11:56:51	harwiltz	Hey guys. Having a really weird issue trying to do AUR updates with pacaur. I haven't updated anything recently because I had exams, but I finished yesterday so I tried updating today. In terms of official repo stuff, as far as I can tell all is good. But when pacaur tries the AUR updates, I get a bunch of integrity check failures. Then I notice my RAM usage is really high, but upon checking htop there is
2016-04-30 11:56:51	harwiltz	no entry taking up a bunch of RAM. So the only way I can think of freeing my RAM is quitting X and starting another X session, but when I try that X breaks. Then I reboot and X is working, but get the same error when I try the AUR update again

2016-05-10 19:31:09	sudokode	no.. but.. they usually don't come in repo form because it's more complexity to maintain, plus the aforementioned problems

So I create /dev/sda1, I make it an EFI partition with fdisk with "t 1 1", then whenever I go to do bootctl install, it tells me it's not an EFI partition. But if I go back and do fdisk /dev/sda again, and make it an EFI system again, redo mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1, it works.

I guess this is a fairly noob-ish question, but what kind of programs do you guys prefer to download source and compile (like from ABS) as opposed to just downloading the binary package? I understand the difference between the two, I'm just not exactly sure when to use ABS. I like the idea of compiling on my system, but should I do that for big packages that I use a lot, like Chromium?

2016-07-02 21:23:47	harwiltz	Sounds like teabah compiles more than Tom
2016-07-02 21:23:49	Tom^	often because of -git, but because of optimisations? no.
2016-07-02 21:23:58	teabah	I use what's in the repos, except when something isn't/
2016-07-02 21:24:08	teabah	Like rc kernels.

2016-07-02 21:25:24	harwiltz	Makes sense I guess
2016-07-02 21:25:40	CaptainCoward	gentoo still makes sense if you want to configure package features
2016-07-02 21:25:56	teabah	Yeah but how often do you need to do that? And for all packages?
2016-07-02 21:26:22	harwiltz	But can't you do the same on Arch? And exactly as teabah said, would you really need to do that that often?

2016-08-12 17:18:25	Jarcode	demonicmaniac3: sure, I wouldn't bet on that though .. (on the other hand, losed source installers are generally retarded, so you never know)

2016-08-12 17:18:58	demonicmaniac3	Jarcode: there's actually a standard utility for that sort of with shar 
2016-08-12 17:19:06	Jarcode	harwiltz: works fine for me
2016-08-12 17:19:11	demonicmaniac3	and unshar and then automatically calling any binary of the extracted stuff

2016-08-12 17:20:53	harwiltz	Jarcode: Thanks
2016-08-12 17:20:54	demonicmaniac3	as amdgpu support for those is experimental
2016-08-12 17:21:10	harwiltz	So RX480 it is :)
2016-08-12 17:21:15	demonicmaniac3	the 1060 is more efficient but nvidia blob only and no nouveau support for a few years probably 
2016-08-12 17:21:34	demonicmaniac3	the amd is cheaper and works with open source already, no idea about the closed amdgpupro stuff though 
2016-08-12 17:21:35	Jarcode	nouveau almost is always slower
2016-08-12 17:21:39	harwiltz	I'm using an nvidia card now and it was a huge hassle getting everything to work properly

2016-08-12 17:22:14	Jarcode	harwiltz: what card?
2016-08-12 17:22:20	demonicmaniac3	nouveau is actually quite decent on old cards now
2016-08-12 17:22:22	harwiltz	I don't game much, so I'd rather have a slower open driver
2016-08-12 17:22:24	demonicmaniac3	as in 8xxx and 9xxx series

2016-08-13 14:05:00	harwiltz	Hey guys. I created a gif using GIMP that I want to play fullscreen. I tried using mpv as recommended here, but for some reason the animation plays really slowly (fps is way too low). Not sure if it's because its 1080p or maybe it's parsing the gif incorrectly. Any idea what could be wrong, or what program I can use as an alternative to mpv?

2016-08-19 16:32:44	shakar	Hello! My work ThinkPad with Arch has today shown a serious problem. Upon bootup, after the password for the encrypted root partition is accepted, the screen goes white with specks of multicolor, followed by an amorphous fade to black. This happens even when modifying the kernel line to boot to runlevel 3, or setting the systemd multi-target value for non-graphical startup. I have uploaded a video of the event here: https://transfer.

2016-08-19 16:32:45	shakar	sh/qizLI/work-thinkpad.mkv The to-white, then amorphous to-black fading is repeated each time I Alt+SysRq+i. The system boots fine from an Antergos live usb I had around, and I can arch-chroot in there, no problem. I upgraded everything (including the kernel) that way, but the same behavior occurs. If anyone can point me in a debugging direction for this, I would very much appreciate it!
2016-08-19 16:32:52	stochastix	pid1: hmm, ok I just didnt think it made sense to have the only user on an instalation have limited powers, but I guess if you need more you probably know how to just set the root pass.

2016-08-19 20:19:34	harwiltz	Hey guys. I spoke earlier about being interested in doing full disk encryption on my next Arch build. Just a few more questions. Firstly, in the video I watched, the guy saved the password key for his /home partition as a random string saved on his drive. If I'm going to have two physical drives, should I have two passwords that are memorized (not saved on disk) in case one of the drives is compromised?

2016-08-20 19:23:00	harwiltz	Hello. I'm gonna be doing my first efi arch install soon so I'm practising on a vm. I selected the efi option in virtualbox and did the install (multiple times now). When I reboot, everything is fine. However, if I do a shutdown (shutdown -h now) and then start up again, stuff gets weird for some reason. It brings me to UEFI Interactive shell, and I don't know what to do.
2016-08-20 19:23:36	solenodic	harwiltz: pretty sure that's just an implementation detail of virtualbox EFI
2016-08-20 19:23:45	solenodic	wait, it happens when you start it back up?

When I boot, I get an error saying the kernel modules failed to load, but it goes away really quickly so I can't read the whole thing. Then everything proceeds to boot as usual. When I do systemctl status, I get Status: degraded. When I try to

2016-08-21 20:39:38	Earnestly	KKKrx: None
2016-08-21 20:39:39	VaultTec	_Trinity_, arch is simple.

2016-08-21 20:40:28	KKKrx	Problems? I haven't had a single problem since installation...
2016-08-21 20:40:33	KKKrx	1 year ago.
2016-08-21 20:40:35	_Trinity_	why is it then, that i meet alot of hmm .. unfriendly is the word, people on the varius forums includeing the arch forum who is lets say indecent in the tone.
2016-08-21 20:40:39	MacGyver	(Not saying that this person isn't. Just don't pretend we're something that we're not.)

2016-08-21 20:41:44	MacGyver	_Trinity_: In principle it's possible to use arch as your first linux distribution, is that what you're asking? Or are you asking whether it's impossible to switch *to* arch?
2016-08-21 20:41:52	MacGyver	Once you've had a different distribution.
2016-08-21 20:41:59	MacGyver	Your question is a bit confusing.

2016-08-21 20:43:51	Earnestly	_Trinity_: Arch is practically vanilla linux, the are no real guard rails, you're responsible for your own actions and the system generally tries to let you get on with it
2016-08-21 20:44:06	MacGyver	_Trinity_: The level of the question (beginner, intermediate, advanced) doesn't matter, what matters is whether the question carries the information needed to answer it, whether the person asking the question has put in some effort to try to understand the problem, etc.
2016-08-21 20:44:09	KKKrx	_Trinity_: well.. it also comes with systemd...

2016-08-21 20:55:20	MacGyver	_Trinity_: Whichever brand you get, rule of thumb is: see if the open-source drivers work for you first, only if they deliver insufficient performance go for the proprietary blob driver.

I currently have a ssd and a hdd, but my grandfather says he has extra hdd's that he isn't using and he'll give me one. I'm planning on building the pc before I get that extra hdd though. When I want to install that hdd, do I have to boot to the installation media to format it and stuff?

2016-08-23 17:16:37	harwiltz	I have a theoretical question about having multiple keys for an encrypted drive. Let's say my external drive (call it drive A) is given a keyfile stored in /etc/ext.key and a password, say 1234. Now I plug that external drive into another one of my computers, and that computer happens to be storing a file /etc/ext.key for another encrypted drive (drive B). Will I be able to unlock drive A on this computer
2016-08-23 17:16:37	harwiltz	even though the keyfile is wrong, or will it prompt me for the 1234 password?

2016-08-23 17:27:30	Max-P	Hmm, quick question. I just launched gnome-session --wayland from my XFCE session, and now all I have is a blinking cursor. Think the Xorg server is recoverable or am I fucked?
2016-08-23 17:27:49	harwiltz	I guess now the only thing I have to figure out for the automated backups is the automatic mounting
2016-08-23 17:27:55	sudokode	launching a gnome session inside an xfce session?
2016-08-23 17:28:04	sudokode	is that... supported...
2016-08-23 17:28:06	sudokode	or wise
2016-08-23 17:28:08	harwiltz	But I'll look into udisk as per grazzolini 's suggestion

2016-08-23 17:28:48	sudokode	you can probably launch individual bits of gnome's desktop inside xfce. I used to do that with xfce and kde actually. mix and match your desktop components
2016-08-23 17:28:53	grazzolini	harwiltz: udisks is for when you want to plug it in and type the password
2016-08-23 17:28:57	harwiltz	I thought it wasn't possible to launch a de from within a de
2016-08-23 17:28:57	Max-P	sudokode: well, I wanted to test something on Wayland real quick. But yeah, I think wayland kicked Xorg out of my vt and then failed to start. Yeah, not a very wise moment
2016-08-23 17:29:03	sudokode	but then wayland...
2016-08-23 17:29:10	sudokode	is xfce running in wayland or X?
2016-08-23 17:29:11	grazzolini	harwiltz: but for real fully automated backups, you use crypttab and fstab
2016-08-23 17:29:25	Max-P	running in X, yeah.
2016-08-23 17:29:45	sudokode	hm.. I'd guess that it's not possible to launch a wayland session from inside X. at least not properly?
2016-08-23 17:29:50	harwiltz	grazzolini: Ohhhhh. I see. I'll try that. I guess I use cron to actually call some sort of backup script?
