2016-08-13 12:36:09	harwiltz	Hey guys. I'm trying to create an animation of a car tachometer, but I don't know how to do the rotation across multiple frames. After one rotation, I don't know how to efficiently select the right part to rotate

2016-08-13 12:54:26	harwiltz	schumaml: Yeah, just did that lol. Forgot you can manually set the duration of each layer, so I set it to 0ms. But is there a way to do a smooth rotation?
2016-08-13 12:54:40	harwiltz	Or do I have to just rotate it manually a bunch of times
2016-08-13 12:59:36	schumaml	you have to do it manually, or use the GASP plug-ins to do that for you
2016-08-13 12:59:43	schumaml	*GAP
