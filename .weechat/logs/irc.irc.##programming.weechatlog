2016-03-12 15:28:07	Jonsky	hahahaah
2016-03-12 15:28:09	harwiltz	The range is just any integer that can fit into a Java integer

2016-03-12 15:28:16	harwiltz	and I believed they are all positive
2016-03-12 15:28:33	ChameleonSix	When i say know i mean some more advanced level of knowledge
2016-03-12 15:28:38	Jonsky	That's awesome
2016-03-12 15:28:51	dubious	ChameleonSix: how advanced?
2016-03-12 15:29:19	+pyon	Rounin: 3+3 is valid Racket... I mean, it's a valid Racket identifier.
2016-03-12 15:29:20	harwiltz	So my solution, since there is no memory efficiency specification, is to just make a huge array that has the size of the greatest integer, initialize everything to -1, and when a new integer is fed change the array at the index of that integer to 0. So if it is already 0, you know theres a repetition
2016-03-12 15:29:26	harwiltz	And that's O(i)
2016-03-12 15:29:30	+pyon	Rounin: It's not 6, though. :-p
2016-03-12 15:29:42	Rounin	harwiltz: Wouldn't that be O(1)?
2016-03-12 15:29:47	dubious	ChameleonSix: The problem with your question is that someone fresh out of uni, after doing some C++ class, may claim to know C++. Someone with 10 years of C++ experience would disagree
2016-03-12 15:29:54	harwiltz	Rounin, no, because the integers are being given one at a time
2016-03-12 15:29:59	+pyon	Rounin: Unless you (define 3+3 6), of course.
2016-03-12 15:30:00	ChameleonSix	Hah yes
2016-03-12 15:30:01	Rounin	harwiltz: Just store the smallest integer in variable a, and the smallest index in variable b
2016-03-12 15:30:21	Rounin	That is, b is the index of a

2016-03-12 15:30:44	harwiltz	I have to find the first time an integer is being entered that has already been entered before
2016-03-12 15:31:03	harwiltz	So if I'm fed 1,2,5,2,7,3 the algorithm would stop at the second 2, for example
2016-03-12 15:31:17	Rounin	Ah, I see, harwiltz... And since looking up in a map is O(log n) worst case, n lookups is n log n
2016-03-12 15:31:26	Rounin	That makes sense

2016-03-12 15:34:02	harwiltz	My algorithm is pretty shitty in terms of memory efficiency, but since memory efficiency isn't specified, do you think my solution is ok/feasible?

2016-03-12 15:34:40	harwiltz	And Rounin, why did you divide by 8 in 4GB/8?

2016-03-12 15:44:06	Rounin	Hm well, depends on the inputs, harwiltz, but yours would be deterministic at least
2016-03-12 15:45:01	harwiltz	Rounin, exactly. I think I can argue that mine is feasible considering the increase in speed, and the way he's recommending storage he can't be bit-specific so he will use more space to store each number

2016-03-13 13:52:41	marchelzo	You start in the middle, and if the middle element is smaller than the one you're looking for, you recursively search the upper half of the array. Otherwise, you recursively search the lower half.

2016-03-13 13:57:39	+InPhase	harwiltz: Also at 0.  But then your difference is 0, which unless it's your target is too small, so you increase it.

2016-03-13 17:18:21	+jeaye	That'd take 2 Exabytes of memory for one bit per each number, harwiltz.
2016-03-13 17:18:22	harwiltz	+jeaye, I'm not worried about running out of space because the prof can technically input all possible integers himself. So the algorithm has to be able to deal with that anyway, just not for every situation I guess. But there is no constraint to the space efficiency on his assignment

2016-03-13 17:24:30	harwiltz	Basically just one bit per possible input, each bit is initially 0, then each input I get I set the corresponding bit to 1 via bit manipulation. So I check if that bit is 1 first, and if it is I stop
2016-03-13 17:24:54	Magnus_RM	but that assumes your input is within a certain range

2016-03-13 17:51:03	harwiltz	rindolf: I need to find a O(i log i) or O(i log^2 i) algorithm that, if given integers one at a time, stops when an integer is entered that has already been entered before. i is the index of the first repeating number
2016-03-13 17:51:49	rindolf	Brando753: well, it wasn't mathematically proven to be impossible yet, just fully traversed without a solution.
2016-03-13 17:52:12	rindolf	harwiltz: ah
2016-03-13 17:52:51	rindolf	harwiltz: can you use a hash?
2016-03-13 17:52:57	harwiltz	rindolf: I initially wanted to use binary trees, but I spoke to my prof and he said we haven't learned eonugh yet and I would have to literally write out all the auto-balancing algorithms and prove their running times
2016-03-13 17:52:58	rindolf	harwiltz: are the integers bounded?
2016-03-13 17:53:18	harwiltz	rindolf, we haven't learned hashes either, and apparently hash search is O(n) in worst case so it wouldn't be good enough
2016-03-13 17:53:37	rindolf	harwiltz: some hashes provide worst-case O(1)
2016-03-13 17:53:41	harwiltz	rindolf, I'm not sure. My current solution allocates 1 bit for every possible entry and using bit manipulation it sets the bits corresponding to each input to 
2016-03-13 17:53:43	harwiltz	to 1
2016-03-13 17:54:06	harwiltz	rindolf, Hmmm. Wikipedia said O(n) lol. We haven't learned hashes yet though
2016-03-13 17:54:23	rindolf	harwiltz: ah,
2016-03-13 17:54:37	rindolf	harwiltz: so you're using a bit vector?
2016-03-13 17:54:37	harwiltz	rindolf, the teacher suggested that I use knowledge of merge sort, binary search, and expansion of ArrayLists 
2016-03-13 17:54:42	harwiltz	rindolf, basically
2016-03-13 17:54:59	harwiltz	I make an array of chars, and from there I can calculate which bit to set
2016-03-13 17:55:11	harwiltz	But I don't think the prof will like that solution
2016-03-13 17:55:30	rindolf	harwiltz: well, if  you're given a large integer , you can run out of memory.

2016-03-13 17:59:36	harwiltz	rindolf, this freecell stuff sounds very interesting. How long does your solver typically take to solve a deal?
2016-03-13 18:00:05	rindolf	Brando753: thing is - several exhaustive solvers fully traversed the deal's graph and found it impossible to solve.
2016-03-13 18:00:28	rindolf	harwiltz: well, it depends on how  you configure it at run time and compile-time.
2016-03-13 18:00:56	rindolf	harwiltz: some heuristics are usually extremely fast.
2016-03-13 18:01:14	harwiltz	rindolf, makes sense. How did you get into making freecell solvers, out of curiosity? I didn't realize freecell was studied so much. Sounds pretty cool though
2016-03-13 18:01:51	rindolf	harwiltz: well, I used to play Freecell on the computer after it came with Win32s.

2016-03-13 19:33:44	harwiltz	XGa8ty3ck, sure. Make an algorithm that, given integers one at a time, stops when an integer is input that has already been entered. It has to run in O(i log i) time, where i is the index of the repeated integer.
2016-03-13 19:33:54	harwiltz	And I cant use binary trees or hashmaps

2016-03-13 19:39:27	vdamewood	Why not use a ternary search tree? ;)
2016-03-13 19:39:30	+_W_	the problem with a binary search is that you need an addressable list (an array) and those typically don't support constant-time insertion
2016-03-13 19:39:31	harwiltz	+_W_, I actually had a similar idea before to keep a linked list and binary search to find the index to insert each element, but I was told that wouldnt work

2016-03-13 19:41:49	harwiltz	It's not that im not allowed to use them, necessarily, but I would have to literally prove every running time and algorithm involved, which sounds like a lot of work. He suggested not doing that

2016-03-13 19:42:54	+InPhase	harwiltz: It is a fundamental requirement for that algorithm that you must store the data, so it is a fundamental requirement that you must have O(log N) or lower insertion.  This has strongly limited your approaches.

2016-03-13 19:46:40	XGa8ty3ck	given that all arrays are of constant size 10, that operation is linear on the length of your integer, that means complexity is log(52234)

2016-03-14 18:33:28	jennifer	My impression of this field is that it's either that you're good with managers or coding and it's hard to find one who is good at both.
2016-03-14 18:33:33	+icp	jennifer, there are many differet roles in software engineering

2016-03-14 18:33:40	+rindolf	jennifer: a good software engineer writes software whose code is more functional and possibly more elegant.

2016-03-14 18:41:30	workmad3	getting all the design done up-front was also a reasonable thing to do when you were dealing with projects that created new hardware, and you were dealing with a 6-12 month lead time before you actually had anything that could even run your code (and that's if things were going well)

2016-03-14 18:45:50	jennifer	workmad3, that's the problem.
2016-03-14 18:45:53	jennifer	I already have an idea.
2016-03-14 18:46:14	jennifer	But working in an open source is one such process that my professor discourages because it has high failure rate, very few open source projects are like Linux or Firefox or whatever.
2016-03-14 18:46:16	workmad3	little_bit: tbh, I shouldn't be surprised... I worked on pre-release smartphones for a while and those could be pretty insane in that regard too

Maybe we logged it and intend to publish it or to use it against you? For this reason, password "Foobarai34\\\\\\" is now compromised. It is therefore insecure and should not be used in any situation

2016-03-14 20:46:16	+PlanckWalk	Treat a new input as an array of size 1.  Merge sort arrays of size 2^k for equal k into an array of size 2^(k+1)
2016-03-14 20:46:27	harwiltz	Oh ok
2016-03-14 20:46:36	+PlanckWalk	If you don't already have an array of size 1, then it just becomes your new array of size 1

2016-03-15 18:37:30	harwiltz	Hey guys. I'm trying to prove a running time for an algorithm PlanckWalk was helping me with yesterday. The problem is, given integers one by one, make an O(i log^2 i) algorithm that returns the index i of the first repeated number

2016-03-15 18:37:59	+Exaeta_mobile	the point is not the math, it's the way the computer handles i5

2016-03-15 18:38:01	+Exaeta_mobile	*it
2016-03-15 18:38:19	harwiltz	The solution is to keep a list of arrays of size 2^k, and merge any two arrays of the same size to keep at most log i arrays of some size 2^k
2016-03-15 18:38:20	+DarkElement	esas, that's why we thought flappy bird would be a good place to start

2016-03-15 18:38:53	harwiltz	Each integer that is given, first binary search on all arrays, then add the new int as a singleton array and merge if necessary

2016-03-15 21:39:06	Happle	YoloGamer: As in, when transactions are received by the database they get given a timestamp, then each object in the database gets given a 'Last read timestamp' and a 'Last write timestamp'
2016-03-15 21:39:09	Xgc	jippex: This is a good time to begin learning about gdb or a similar debugger.
2016-03-15 21:39:22	YoloGamer	jippex, nice. You called i for a index and it's not even initialized.
2016-03-15 21:39:46	Happle	YoloGamer: Then if there is a clash with the timestamp, the transaction gets restarted
2016-03-15 21:40:06	Happle	YoloGamer: its all to do with managing concurrency in the database
2016-03-15 21:40:13	YoloGamer	Happle, You can set a collum to be last read, last write, and update them when you perform any transaction

2016-03-15 21:52:54	YoloGamer	jippex, You can't assume the array size especially if you consider taking input from a user so I highly sugget you import stdlib and use sizeof

2016-03-15 21:53:17	jippex	myrl-saki, can divide 6

2016-03-15 21:53:26	Myrl-saki	jippex: He's wrong then.
2016-03-15 21:53:39	Myrl-saki	jippex: 6 % array[i] == 0
2016-03-15 21:53:43	YoloGamer	jippex, So you need to store the length of the array of numbers to be sorted, so lets store it in a variable called L
2016-03-15 21:54:05	Myrl-saki	6 % array[i] == 0 iff array[i] \in {1, 2, 3}
2016-03-15 21:54:07	YoloGamer	Now you need somewhere to store the index location you are referencing so lets call it i
2016-03-15 21:54:16	Myrl-saki	iff 0 < array[i] <= 3
2016-03-15 21:54:58	YoloGamer	So you have two integers, l and i. l = length, i = index. You need to set l to the size of the array so we use sizeof. So int l = sizeof(my_array);
2016-03-15 21:55:10	Myrl-saki	if (0 < array[i] && array[i] <= 3)
2016-03-15 21:55:31	YoloGamer	For i, we need to initialize it, so int i = 0; i will store where we are poking at the array like a counter
2016-03-15 21:55:53	Myrl-saki	I have to go
2016-03-15 21:55:59	YoloGamer	The best way to think of an array is to think of a rolldex that is numbered. you can do roldex[index] to get the contents in the roldex at index
2016-03-15 21:56:25	YoloGamer	We're doing that with i and l though

2016-03-15 21:57:09	YoloGamer	So lets say we want to step throug the array and increment i to the next location of the array with each pass. we'd use while(i < l){}
2016-03-15 21:57:30	YoloGamer	This means as long as index is smaller than the last location in our array we continue.
2016-03-15 21:57:58	YoloGamer	So your goal was to figure out if the number at i was dividable by 6 without having any leftover value aka 0
2016-03-15 21:58:18	YoloGamer	So inside of our while loop we'll do a quick comparison using modulus (%)

2016-03-16 10:36:07	harwiltz	My question is, within the karatsuba algorithm, how do you know when you're doing 'long multiplication/addition' or just 64 bit arithmetic?
2016-03-16 10:36:29	+ams`	you don't.
2016-03-16 10:36:43	+ams`	the karatsuba algorithm has no clue about the width of a number.
2016-03-16 10:36:48	harwiltz	ams`: So then how can I possibly go about solving the running time?
2016-03-16 10:37:14	+lethargilistic	harwiltz: The system you're working on has fixed width numbers
2016-03-16 10:37:20	harwiltz	ams`: I know how many 64 bit 'digits' are in the terms
2016-03-16 10:37:30	+lethargilistic	So It would be 64 bits or 32 bit integers, probably.
2016-03-16 10:37:36	harwiltz	lethargilistic: Ok, but I'm breaking up numbers to base 2^64
2016-03-16 10:37:55	harwiltz	And there are about 1.5 million digits in the number in base 2^64
2016-03-16 10:38:12	+lethargilistic	Technically, even normal addition with binary digits is O(n), but it is bounded by a constant, so it's O(64) or simply O(1).
2016-03-16 10:38:16	+ams`	base 2^64?!

2016-03-18 19:15:49	harwiltz	InPhase: So the only problem with mine is that you can't insert into an arraylist in constant time right?
2016-03-18 19:15:50	minous	Tazmain, now I'm confused again. Did you want the source package, for which you compile your own version (for Android, or whatever)? Or did you want a binary download for your Arch system?

2016-03-24 19:07:16	harwiltz	Hey guys. I'm having a weird issue as I'm trying to create a fast data structure for searching
2016-03-24 19:07:20	c-pyon-s	justJanne: “pretty useless” --> I wouldn't be so sure. While obviously multigraphs are more general than normal graphs, graphs do have their uses, e.g., modeling connectedness problems.
2016-03-24 19:07:43	harwiltz	I made a binary tree and another data structure (that I called a bitfield) which stores an array of bytes so that there is one bit for every possible input
2016-03-24 19:07:46	Shayanjm	I just haven't used bigtable before so I can't comment intelligently on its particular features
2016-03-24 19:07:54	Shayanjm	but BigTable != Mongodb != Google cloud storage
2016-03-24 19:08:07	justJanne	if anyone ever is going to start suggesting me to use a NoSQL database for storing relational data like product->manufacturer, product->category, EVER again, I’ll probably webscale their neck.
2016-03-24 19:08:09	harwiltz	The bitfield adds items by using bit manipulations to turn on the bit that corresponds to the input
2016-03-24 19:08:28	Shayanjm	justJanne: You added the manufacturer bit

2016-03-24 19:08:56	harwiltz	However, I ran some tests and the search for the binary tree is consistently faster than that of the bitfield for any input I've tried (they've all been over a million).
2016-03-24 19:08:59	crutchy	ergh. webscale
2016-03-24 19:09:00	harwiltz	How is this possible?
2016-03-24 19:09:06	Shayanjm	justJanne: then you've chosen the wrong database because you scoped your problem domain incorrectly
2016-03-24 19:09:15	justJanne	Shayanjm: no, because the domain can change.
2016-03-24 19:09:32	justJanne	You don’t know what the market will look like in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years.
2016-03-24 19:09:36	justJanne	Don’t try to model it,
2016-03-24 19:09:43	Shayanjm	lol what
2016-03-24 19:09:44	justJanne	build a system that you can change iteratively.
2016-03-24 19:09:57	justJanne	Or do you use waterfall for everything at Etsy?
2016-03-24 19:10:04	Shayanjm	again, I have never worked at Etsy
2016-03-24 19:10:35	Shayanjm	I've worked with the tech lead @ Etsy (I mentioned Etsy because it was one of the first 5 production deploys of mongo back in 2012)
2016-03-24 19:10:38	+koollman	the actual webscale architecture: stay flexible, change as needed, avoid vendor lock-in :)
2016-03-24 19:11:14	justJanne	most importantly, don’t pretend to know your architecture before you have built it.
2016-03-24 19:11:25	+koollman	or after you have built it ;)
2016-03-24 19:11:28	justJanne	which means that very often you have to add one or two relations,

2016-03-24 19:15:40	justJanne	realistically, we can just hope actual graph databases become a lot faster soon, so we can throw away the whole RDBMS and NoSQL cruft.
2016-03-24 19:15:59	Shayanjm	so either you gained a lot by limiting yourself to one sub-par db implementation (which is unlikely since most DBMS are not very heavy)

2016-03-24 19:17:50	crutchy	of course

2016-03-24 19:26:31	harwiltz	The bitfield adds items by using bit manipulations to turn on the bit that corresponds to the input
2016-03-24 19:26:33	harwiltz	However, I ran some tests and the search for the binary tree is consistently faster than that of the bitfield for any input I've tried (they've all been over a million).
2016-03-24 19:26:35	harwiltz	How is this possible?

2016-03-24 19:27:41	hppavilion[1]	harwiltz: Probably has to do with the speed of single-bit operations?

2016-03-24 19:28:15	harwiltz	hppavilion[1]: Really? I'm not doing that many of them, and aren't bit operations supposed to be fast?
2016-03-24 19:28:20	justJanne	specifically, single-bit operations are quite hard to pipeline
2016-03-24 19:28:24	hppavilion[1]	harwiltz: Maybe, I'm not good with hardware
2016-03-24 19:28:43	justJanne	the branch predictor usually doesn’t like them
2016-03-24 19:28:47	c-pyon-s	harwiltz: Using low-level operations doesn't automatically make your code fast.
2016-03-24 19:28:52	c-pyon-s	harwiltz: You have to use good algorithms!
2016-03-24 19:28:54	hppavilion[1]	harwiltz: Do you use 2**n to calculate which bit?
2016-03-24 19:29:04	crutchy	in some languages low level functions are abstracted anyway
2016-03-24 19:29:06	hppavilion[1]	harwiltz: (** is exponentiation)
2016-03-24 19:29:07	harwiltz	c-pyon-s: I believe my algorithm is good. I don't see how it can be faster
2016-03-24 19:29:09	+little_bit	nitrix: so, lesson learned: don't do early returns unless you can clean up your input.
2016-03-24 19:29:18	+little_bit	nitrix: annnnnd clean your input before you send.
2016-03-24 19:29:18	justJanne	hppavilion[1]: the compiler should optimize that away, too

2016-03-24 19:30:11	hppavilion[1]	harwiltz: And I assume you have a function that takes a value, raises 2 to it, and adds that value to zero to get the bitsetter?
2016-03-24 19:30:20	justJanne	hppavilion[1]: spending a uni course reversing software and learning ASM and learning how to deal with all the low level stuff was pretty awesome. Especially trying to understand how C source relates to the assembler output, and back.

2016-04-09 14:31:14	harwiltz	Hi guys. I have an assignment with the question 'Consider a situation where you have to operate on a large set S. You have to handle three operations on S: S.min() returns and removes the min in S. S.max() returns and removes the max in S. S.insert(x) inserts an element x in S. Show how to implement the set S so that any of these operations can be performed in time O(log n), where n is the current
2016-04-09 14:31:14	harwiltz	number of elements in S.
2016-04-09 14:31:39	harwiltz	Can't you just say S is a max heap though? Actually it can be a min heap too by my logic

2016-04-09 14:35:32	harwiltz	GeDaMo: Why can't it be a max heap though? For max heap, it takes constant time to find the max element and O(log n) to remove it, right?

2016-04-09 19:33:37	Shayanjm	because you need to essentially nullify the signals of what they're currently listening to while making sure that your hijack signal doesn't overlap with any of your destructive standing waves
2016-04-09 19:33:58	Shayanjm	and I don't think you can guarantee that without having prior knowledge of the signals in the system you're trying to jam/hijack
2016-04-09 19:34:24	menwithHill	he said "headphones"

2016-04-09 19:36:50	mnopstuvv	DarkElement: Is this how it works ? You use IDE to help program or programming , you use programming to make a calendar , and calendar to tell date . Is that correct ?
2016-04-09 19:36:54	Magnus_RM	the magnetic field is proportionate to the current
2016-04-09 19:37:06	DarkElement	Magnus_RM, but coils of wire must come into account
2016-04-09 19:37:21	DarkElement	mnopstuvv, You could do that yea.
2016-04-09 19:37:23	Magnus_RM	yes, number of windings has the same impact
2016-04-09 19:37:33	DarkElement	Are they equal in their impact?
2016-04-09 19:37:36	Magnus_RM	yes
2016-04-09 19:37:49	DarkElement	Still need a formula to know how many coils = how much current
2016-04-09 19:37:52	Shayanjm	Magnus_RM: do you have the formula offhand
2016-04-09 19:38:00	Shayanjm	because i don't think they're equal in proportion
2016-04-09 19:38:02	DarkElement	And the radius of the coil
2016-04-09 19:38:02	Magnus_RM	double the current or double the windings will give the same increase of field strength
2016-04-09 19:38:10	DarkElement	That's great but I need the formula
2016-04-09 19:38:19	DarkElement	Now I do, anyways
2016-04-09 19:38:19	Magnus_RM	it is easy to find, just search
2016-04-09 19:38:23	Shayanjm	Magnus_RM DarkElement: doubling the current is nontrivial to do
2016-04-09 19:38:31	Shayanjm	so typically more windings is easier to achieve

2016-04-09 19:40:14	Shayanjm	N = number of turns of wire on the electromagnet
2016-04-09 19:40:32	Shayanjm	mu = permeability of the core material (i.e: it's a constant depending on what you're using as an electromagnet)

2016-04-09 20:48:33	+harwiltz	mnopstuvv: Try writing a program in an IDE, then writing one in vim, for example. Firstly, the IDE has code completion usually, syntax highlighting, a nice file manager, compiles stuff for you...
2016-04-09 20:48:56	+harwiltz	mnopstuvv: vim can do some of that, but it will take much more work and will be less user friendly
2016-04-09 20:49:03	bacon1989	better yet, everyone should just use emacs

2016-04-09 20:53:21	+harwiltz	ackpacket: So for O(n), I would have to use a base other than base n
2016-04-09 20:53:32	+Shayanjm	5) low overhead

2016-04-09 20:53:44	bacon1989	it's good for terminal work

2016-04-09 20:53:55	+harwiltz	ackpacket: Say you have an array of n integers bounded by the polynomial n^k. Show that radix sort using k rounds is O(n)

2016-04-09 20:54:57	bacon1989	I can find things in a codefile using emacs than a traditional IDE in most cases. You can make your way around a codebase really fast
2016-04-09 20:55:13	+Shayanjm	which eliminates that little bit of friction you might see when you're scrolling furiously through your code trying to find specific spots/files
2016-04-09 20:55:16	+harwiltz	But it takes much more effort to get setup
2016-04-09 20:55:31	bacon1989	i'm comparing it to eclipse though, it seems to suck at finding text quickly

2016-04-09 20:56:06	+Millz	yeah I've only really used eclipse as an ide, netbeans a few times and notepad++ ofc

2016-04-09 20:56:25	+ackpacket	Shayanjm: SOOOOO useful
2016-04-09 20:56:26	+Shayanjm	you can do anything from find files to find function definitions by typing the first few letters and it autocompletes
2016-04-09 20:56:39	+ackpacket	Shayanjm: doesn't even have to be first few, it's a fuzzy search
2016-04-09 20:56:43	+Shayanjm	yeah
2016-04-09 20:56:46	+Shayanjm	and it's really fast

2016-04-09 21:21:16	+harwiltz	mnopstuvv: It makes writing code potentially easier/quicker. For example, IDE's usually have code completion, which is very helpful if youre new to a language because it fills out function names and stuff for you

2016-04-09 21:22:22	+pyon	bacon1989: Why?
2016-04-09 21:22:30	bacon1989	there is something new in 1.8 which speeds things up a bit

2016-04-09 22:05:06	joaumg	keybinding on websites? remembers me the vimium plugin '-'
2016-04-09 22:05:08	bacon1989	that would be the most basic
2016-04-09 22:05:26	+picobit	the network should own the processes, the processes should own their ports, the network should own the wiring..
2016-04-09 22:05:34	+picobit	the processes should update according to the wiring.
2016-04-09 22:05:58	+picobit	therefore the amount of wiring should be at least equal to the amount of ports in the system.

2016-04-09 23:04:23	+Shayanjm	right, so now you might have die_count = [0,0,0,0,0,0], where you have an element that corresponds to the frequency that each face has rolled

2016-04-09 23:06:01	omie	wait im confused
2016-04-09 23:06:20	+Shayanjm	remember
2016-04-09 23:06:28	+Shayanjm	you're using every element to hold the frequency of its corresponding die face
2016-04-09 23:06:31	adempus	purplereign no, I used the "./" to access the contents of the file, but need to access the path string without the "./" to actually use the contents.
2016-04-09 23:06:47	+Shayanjm	so for instance element 0 in the list (the very first element) might hold 1 if face 1 was rolled once
2016-04-09 23:07:03	+Shayanjm	element 1 in the list (the second element) might hold 4 if face #2 was rolled 4 times

2016-04-09 23:44:40	+purplereign	_W_: Part of the problem is that given a fixed block size and a non-zero compression ratio you can't know which block to jump to without decompressing everything and counting the elements.
2016-04-09 23:44:40	+nitrix	_W_: More or less. Since the data is compressed, how do you know which block what you want is going to be, without decompressing the first blocks?
2016-04-09 23:44:54	+purplereign	_W_: e.g. Block 1 can have 5 elements compressed and block 2 can have 20.

If you have the following as a minmax heap: [2,17,19,3,5,4,9,11,12,8,15,13,16,14,18], when I try removing the min I get an issue, because you replace the root with the last element (18) and then I can't figure out how to restructure in O(log n)

I recall from my assembly classes being told that multiply and division are very expensive calls, if you need to make them very often (I'm optimizing a working system, it's OK!) - is that true in practice, or do compilers do some crazy magic? the question is specifically about C.
2016-04-16 11:51:26	+_W_	not so much compilers, but modern CPUs are better than old ones were

2016-04-27 19:43:55	harwiltz	Hi guys. I'm trying to solve a recurrence of a function but the solution I'm looking at slightly disagrees with mine. The issue is that on the recursive call, the parameter passed into the function is list.getNext(), which is a constant time function. Also, there is a print statement before that. My answer was T(n) = 2 + T(n-1), but the solution says 1 + T(n-1). Don't you have to count the getNext()
2016-04-27 19:43:55	harwiltz	call?

2016-04-27 19:48:05	+kadoban	harwiltz: The key to why you're getting a different answer is: what are the units on the function you're measuring? What computational model is this. Knowing many CS courses that teach this stuff … they probably haven't bothered to specify.
2016-04-27 19:48:08	zalatovo	harwiltz: and only count the list operations for instance
2016-04-27 19:48:17	harwiltz	zalatovo: Actually, in the solution, it says that the print was counted

2016-04-27 19:49:22	+kadoban	"a recurrence of a function" doesn't really mean anything, just throwing that out there.
2016-04-27 19:49:31	+kadoban	So a lot is being assumed here.
2016-04-27 19:49:57	harwiltz	kadoban: if T(n) is defined recursively, find a non-recursive definition of T(n)
2016-04-27 19:50:53	+kadoban	harwiltz: Sure, that makes sense. Now, what is T(n), and how does it relate to the procedure you're trying to characterize … something of. What is it supposed to be modelling? What model is it using?
2016-04-27 19:51:20	harwiltz	kadoban: T(n) is a model of the running time of an algorithm
