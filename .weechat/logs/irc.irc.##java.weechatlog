2016-03-23 16:05:03	squeakytoy	can i ask a opinionated question. New languages are growing on trees nowdays. Node.js/js, dart, go, rust - what is it with Java that makes you keep coding Java?
2016-03-23 16:05:07	Carisius	dunno but i remember myself doing 3d in java with java3d some years ago in older hardware

2016-03-23 16:05:39	harwiltz	Hey guys. I'm trying to implement a Tree structure in which each node keeps track of its parent node. So if each node refers to another node, does it store all of the data of the other node, or does it just store a memory address (pointer)?
2016-03-23 16:05:43	daseiboshi	Basically, not just basic libraries but advanced software platforms and frameworks.

2016-03-23 16:07:35	squeakytoy	Carisius, so you think there are more fun languages to work with, personally, but since java is so huge, it makes you stick with it?

2016-03-24 18:54:07	harwiltz	Hey guys. I'm trying to write a fast search data structure. So far I made a binary tree and another class that basically stores enough bytes so that there is one bit per possible input. Using bit manipulation, adding elements switches on the bits that have been input and then searching is similar. I'm benchmarking them now to see which is faster.

2016-03-24 18:55:09	harwiltz	Considering search in a binary tree is O(log n) in a good case, and search for my other data structure should be constant, I would expect my bit array thing to search through 10000000 elements much faster
2016-03-24 18:55:23	harwiltz	However, my binary search is always faster
2016-03-24 18:55:53	harwiltz	Is it possible that explicit casting takes really long or something?
2016-03-24 18:56:09	harwiltz	Otherwise I don't see how this result is possible
2016-03-24 18:56:31	mike802	trees are very memory ineffecient and don't often run at O(log n) in practice
2016-03-24 18:56:40	mike802	due to system restrictions
2016-03-24 18:56:46	harwiltz	mike802: I know. But my tree search is much faster for some reason
2016-03-24 18:56:48	SagaciousZed	and yet it is still faster
2016-03-24 18:57:11	SagaciousZed	and when you say bit array what is the actual type?
2016-03-24 18:57:13	harwiltz	Sorry, not much faster, but consistently faster. I expected the other to be much faster for input size of ten million
2016-03-24 18:57:24	harwiltz	SagaciousZed: I created it. It just stores an array of byte
