2016-02-14 12:09:10	CarlosPL	Hi there. I have to solve for class the Riccati equation. The thing is that I have to solve it by myself, so I shouldn't look on Wikipedia and stuff. Could you just give me a hint of where to start? Maybe by using variation of constants? Thanks in advance.
2016-02-14 12:09:20	harwiltz	Hey can anyone help me with some algebra that involves modulo?

2016-02-14 12:11:43	peterpacz1	If I have a sequence C, and 4 subsequences. I would like to refer to them as S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4 so I can use one letter rather than a, b, c, etc.
2016-02-14 12:11:44	harwiltz	I'm trying to solve for n, but they keep cancelling out
2016-02-14 12:12:06	peterpacz1	However I'm not sure if it's correct to use S underscore, as that would be used to refer to an element in the sequence.
2016-02-14 12:12:23	peterpacz1	Should I use S^1, S^2, S^3? I'm not sure if that's notationally correct either.

2016-02-14 12:22:56	harrynoob	you could try it out Gloomy by just writing out the matrix product in the 2x2 case, and seeing if you can find any counterexamples

2016-02-15 22:13:32	MotivicScones	so, \omega can be thought of as the order type of N itself

2016-02-15 22:14:09	harwiltz	Hello everyone. I have a proof that I'm really stuck on. I have to prove that the sum from i=1 to n of i^k is in theta(n^(k+1)), but I'm pretty sure what I did is not legitimate
2016-02-15 22:14:22	MotivicScones	nah, I only take hand-delivered invitations. and it has to be written on papyrus in classical Latin, with proper calligraphy.

2016-02-15 22:16:05	neochronomo	MotivicScones: So what you're saying is that I'm getting the wrong impression by saying omega is "After" the set N. That what's actually going on is that you can list all the elements of N and more, and if you order them correctly, they'll still biject with N?
2016-02-15 22:16:55	MotivicScones	neochronomo: there are lots of ordinals that are in bijection with N
2016-02-15 22:17:04	MotivicScones	the difference is what ordering you put on them
2016-02-15 22:17:15	MotivicScones	for example, if you put the usual ordering on N, it has order type omega
2016-02-15 22:17:31	MotivicScones	but if you instead say n < 0 for all positive integers n, then it has order type omega + 1
2016-02-15 22:17:51	MotivicScones	(because 0 then comes after a set with order type omega)

2016-02-15 22:18:53	MotivicScones	yes, we're *defining* an order relation
2016-02-15 22:19:12	MotivicScones	(thinking of the elements as meaningless symbols)
2016-02-15 22:19:13	harwiltz	Can anyone help me prove that the greatest power of n in the sum from i=1 to n of i^k is n^(k+1)
2016-02-15 22:20:33	MotivicScones	for another example, consider the set of all pairs (m, n) of natural numbers, where the order relation is defined by (m_1, n_1) < (m_2, n_2) if m_1 < m_2 or if m_1 = m_2 and n_1 < n_2.
2016-02-15 22:21:36	MotivicScones	in this case, the ordering is (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), ..., (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., and so on -- so we have omega many copies of omega
2016-02-15 22:21:45	MotivicScones	this is called omega^2, quite reasonably

2016-02-15 22:24:35	MotivicScones	fun fact: you can do induction on any well-ordered set, not just the natural numbers
2016-02-15 22:25:09	neochronomo	MotivicScones: Was what I was saying earlier valid then? That it's not really correct to think of omega (and omega+1, +2, etc..) being after the set N? That it's more about a set with omega(+) elements and realizing they have the same cardinality as N?
2016-02-15 22:26:07	MotivicScones	no, it's fine to think of omega as coming after all the finite ordinal numbers (which you can identify with the elements of N)

2016-02-15 22:58:12	harwiltz	Say v is Mikes speed and t is Mikes time. Bob's speed is 90/(t - 18) which is also equal to v + 10. But v = 90/t, so 90/(t - 18) = 90/t + 10
2016-02-15 22:59:01	harwiltz	Actually convert that 18 to 18/60 because speed is in mph
2016-02-15 22:59:57	harwiltz	Then solve for t, which gives easy access to v -> v = 90/t

2016-02-15 23:17:37	harwiltz	Ok but you still have to formally prove that sum i^k is theta n^(k+1). I thought you were trying to do that with induction
2016-02-15 23:17:56	brett1479	harwiltz, I don't know what you are saying ... I have proven that
2016-02-15 23:18:14	harwiltz	How did you prove that i^k <= n^(k+1)?
2016-02-15 23:18:36	brett1479	sum (k = 1 to n) i^k <= sum (k = 1 to n) n^k = n^(k+1)
2016-02-15 23:18:56	harwiltz	Oh shit... that's clever
2016-02-15 23:18:58	MotivicScones	harwiltz: you don't need induction to do that
2016-02-15 23:19:13	harwiltz	I didn't notice the sum n^k
2016-02-15 23:19:25	harwiltz	Thanks guys let me try writing this
2016-02-15 23:19:38	brett1479	harwiltz, do you understand my lower bound?
2016-02-15 23:20:16	harwiltz	Not quite sure, definitely get the upper bound though.
2016-02-15 23:20:29	brett1479	I only use the upper half of the terms and lower bound them by n/2
2016-02-15 23:20:42	brett1479	if you want to get precise you can handle the floor/ceilings as necessary
2016-02-15 23:20:47	harwiltz	Thats what I was just thinking... really smart. How did you come up with that so quickly?
2016-02-15 23:20:56	brett1479	Practice

2016-02-15 23:21:46	harwiltz	Well you sir are majestic. This was way simpler than I thought it would be. Not to undermine how clever that was, but I thought I'd be doing some really messy shit
2016-02-15 23:21:56	harwiltz	Your solution is quite elegant
2016-02-15 23:22:20	brett1479	When you do asymptotics things can get very easy
2016-02-15 23:22:26	brett1479	since you can ignore a lot of stuff
2016-02-15 23:22:41	brett1479	harwiltz, one book that has some of these tricks is Concrete Mathematics, if I recall correctly
2016-02-15 23:22:49	harwiltz	That's what I figured. I knew there had to be some sort of simplification due to the asymptotics, but I thought I had to use induction for sure
2016-02-15 23:23:04	harwiltz	brett1479, cool, thanks! I'll try to get that. Sounds good
2016-02-15 23:23:21	harwiltz	brett1479, sorry, but can you just tell me if I got the lower bound properly?

2016-02-15 23:25:00	enthdegree	naively it seems like L1 error should be the standard metric
2016-02-15 23:25:23	enthdegree	but when you learn more about statistics and integration/convergence in general it becomes clear that L2 convergence is what you generally end up working with
2016-02-15 23:25:35	harwiltz	So, you're doing the sum from i=1 to n of i^k is greater than the same from i=1 to n/2 n^k?
2016-02-15 23:25:39	enthdegree	because it generates a hilbert space, etc
2016-02-15 23:25:44	harwiltz	*you're saying
2016-02-15 23:26:05	harwiltz	*and greater than the sum, not the same
2016-02-15 23:27:21	harwiltz	brett1479, nevermind, I'm dumb. You're saying the sum i^k is greater than the sum i=1 to n of (n/2)^k

What is the probability that no run of six (or more) consecutive heads occurs? - I know I can get the number of 8 tail coin flips by (1+x)^25, which for x^8 the coefficient is C(25,8), but I'm stuck on how to apply the generating function to the "no more than 6 in a row" part - I
2016-02-18 22:24:35	aeiro	thought about doing (1+x+x^2+...+x^25)^something but wasn't really able to figure out where to take it from there - I also thought about finding the coefficient for x^25 in the equation (1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5)^something,  but I'm not sure what that something should be
2016-02-18 22:24:36	harwiltz	Is it because there are four rows in the matrix and thus solving both systems would have at least four unknowns, but you only have three equations?

2016-02-18 22:32:07	harwiltz	MotivicScones, is it because there are too many variables in the matrix A and not enough information given in the predicate that A[2,-32,10] = [1,0,0,0] to make for the same amount of equations as unknowns?
2016-02-18 22:32:22	rooftopjoe	how do i prove that the area of a square is l^2? if i can do that, it's super trivial to "kickstart" most of everything else: areas of rectangles, triangles, circles, trigonometric functions, integrals, etc. but i'm unsure about this particular step.
2016-02-18 22:32:35	rooftopjoe	do i simply postulate it?

2016-02-18 22:36:29	MotivicScones	rooftopjoe: there are a few different approaches to defining area, and a fundamental question like that probably depends heavily on which approach you take
2016-02-18 22:36:30	randomA	a vector field is like a plane where every point on the plane has a vector?
2016-02-18 22:36:34	harwiltz	randomA, its like a regular integral except instead of being on a straight line its on a curve
2016-02-18 22:36:54	rooftopjoe	MotivicScones: can you give me examples?
2016-02-18 22:37:00	randomA	ok, but what does it mean for a vector field to be over a curve?
2016-02-18 22:37:21	rooftopjoe	feels like there need to be some basic axioms for areas.
2016-02-18 22:37:25	harwiltz	randomA, think about work, as in the physics quantity
2016-02-18 22:37:26	MotivicScones	rooftopjoe: you can define area axiomatically, and there are several different ways to do so
2016-02-18 22:37:51	harwiltz	randomA, your curve has a direction, and so does your vector field at a given point
2016-02-18 22:37:53	rooftopjoe	ok, that's what i imagined: just say that a square with l=1 has area 1
2016-02-18 22:37:53	ron88	anyone care to give it a crack?   Find the sum (2/3)+(2/3)^2 + (2/3)^3 +...+(2/3?^100
2016-02-18 22:37:57	rooftopjoe	that seems like enough
2016-02-18 22:37:59	MotivicScones	or you can talk about measures and define area that way

2016-02-18 22:38:07	randomA	harwiltz: ok, so then what does it mean for the vector field to be over a curve
2016-02-18 22:38:08	MotivicScones	or a few other approaches I'm probably forgetting
2016-02-18 22:38:14	randomA	does it mean that the curve runs through a vector field?
2016-02-18 22:38:18	rooftopjoe	measures? not sure what you mean
2016-02-18 22:38:28	harwiltz	randomA, so your line integral of the vector field of the curve is just the integral of F *dot* dr, where r is the parametrization of the curve
2016-02-18 22:38:34	MotivicScones	randomA: here's what it looks like geometrically: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Line_integral_of_vector_field.gif
2016-02-18 22:38:38	harwiltz	and dr because dr points tangent to the curve
2016-02-18 22:39:08	ron88	I can use the Formula N=(J/D)+1 but I am not sure how to subtract (2/3) from (2/3)^100
2016-02-18 22:39:09	harwiltz	MotivicScones, I'm pretty lost here. Can you give me a hint?
2016-02-18 22:39:15	randomA	i really don't understand.
2016-02-18 22:39:21	MotivicScones	the line integral measures how much the vector field points in the same direction as the curve

2016-02-18 22:40:35	randomA	so the line integral is work in physics, so work is how much the force points in a direction over some distance, which is the curve
2016-02-18 22:40:40	harwiltz	MotivicScones, is the dimension 2?
2016-02-18 22:40:48	MotivicScones	why is it 2?

2016-02-18 22:41:25	harwiltz	MotivicScones, because the nullspace contains two unparallel vectors, meaning two independent vectors, meaning it has 2 vectors in its basis
2016-02-18 22:41:39	MotivicScones	okay, so that says the null space has dimension at least 2

2016-02-18 22:41:50	MotivicScones	what about the image?
2016-02-18 22:42:00	harwiltz	MotivicScones, doesn't it mean exactly two?

2016-02-18 22:42:13	harwiltz	and I've never heard the term image in this context

2016-02-18 23:10:31	MotivicScones	and here's an easy way to see this: take a basis v_1, v_2 of the null space. now take a vector w not in the null space.
2016-02-18 23:10:36	opraaa	ah
2016-02-18 23:10:50	MotivicScones	these form a basis of R^3  (because there's 3 of them and they're linearly independent)
2016-02-18 23:10:56	harwiltz	MotivicScones, so since the dimension can only be 1, you can't have anything other than 0 in the last three components?

Then later on you went on to functions that were curved.  Slope fell kind of by the wayside for a while.  You also covered some tools that you could use when the things that you were working with aren't, you know, actually functions - they had relationships that weren't as simplistic as y = (some stuff
2016-02-23 20:06:58	Vornicus	about x).  Then even later you hit calculus: slopes came back and hard; the goal now was to come up with a function that met the relationship between the function and its slope at each point, and in reverse as well.

I think it is, because I believe I have found constants and minimum values of n to satisfy the definition of Theta, but I want to make sure

2016-03-03 21:31:59	enecon	by followin the proof
2016-03-03 21:32:05	enecon	that its the supremum
2016-03-03 21:32:09	harwiltz	I got the lower bound because if you choose ca and cb to be equal in ca*n + cb * nlogn, then you just need ca to be greater than c0 in c0 * nlogn <= ca * n + ca * nlogn because the limit as n approaches infinity of nlogn/n(1+logn) is 1
2016-03-03 21:32:49	harwiltz	And of course you'd need to find a matching n0 to suit this, but I know that's possible

2016-03-07 22:52:43	Galois	I don't see where in 1.20 Rudin uses well-ordering. In 2.8, Rudin uses well-ordering only on the natural numbers. He doesn't use the well-ordering theorem anywhere.
2016-03-07 22:52:45	rofl	harwiltz, "Thus 0 and 1 are dual, and ∧ and ∨ are dual. The Duality Principle, also called De Morgan duality, asserts that Boolean algebra is unchanged when all dual pairs are interchanged."

2016-03-07 22:54:09	Raptors	wait nvm
2016-03-07 22:54:12	Galois	and that fact is definitely not commonly referred to as the well-ordering theorem. It's called the well-ordering principle.
2016-03-07 22:54:25	rofl	Raptors, no, you have 0 = 8 + 6n + 39 + 4n + 4
2016-03-07 22:54:27	Galois	The well-ordering theorem is a completely different, and much more controversial theorem.

2016-03-07 22:55:23	HStevens	Galois: then sorry, I wasn't aware about this difference in terminology, I meant he uses well-ordering principle and he doesn't say about it
2016-03-07 22:55:23	rofl	sorry -51/10
2016-03-07 22:55:49	HStevens	Galois: in 1.20 you have two possibilites, as far as I remember either you use well-ordering principle or induction
2016-03-07 22:55:55	Galois	from the first paragraph of the book: "We shall not, however, enter into any discussion of the axioms that govern the integers, but assume familiarity with the rational numbers."
2016-03-07 22:56:09	Raptors	rofl, which is what I had here: http://i.imgur.com/Gbqwrs6.jpg
2016-03-07 22:56:27	Galois	so basically if you complain that Rudin should have covered induction and WOP then you're complaining that Rudin is the wrong book. Which is fine, but he did warn you.
2016-03-07 22:56:33	Galois	and there are plenty of other books which DO cover that material
2016-03-07 22:56:37	Raptors	did it correctly but forgot to set the correct sign above
2016-03-07 22:56:59	HStevens	Galois: yes, but the gap in 1.20 is so serious that you'll find an article about it on the Internet. Also, people were asking about how to fill it, so something is there
2016-03-07 22:57:01	kamog	Galois: well-ordering when not related to naturals is the axiom of choice?

I can choose one option and get 2/4, or if I choose the other option, a random-number generator decides if I get 6/4 or 0/4. I don't know much probability, but the latter sounds favorable.

2016-03-19 17:21:11	duncannz	Okay so I start by rearranging x+5<18/(x+2) into (x+8)(x-1)/(x+2) but I'll leave the working for that out. Then I write: We now determine the critical points to be $x+8=0\iff x=-8$, $x-1=0\iff x=1$, and $x+2=0\iff x=-2$. This divides the number line into the intervals $(-\infty,-8)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(-2,1)$, and $(1,\infty)$. We now check the sign of $\frac{(x+8)(x-1)}{x+2}$ within each of these ranges: $(-\infty,-8)$: negative, $(-8,-2)$:
2016-03-19 17:21:11	duncannz	positive, $(-2,1)$: negative, $(1,\infty)$: positive. Since we want $\frac{(x+8)(x-1)}{x+2}<0$, we choose the two ranges that give negative numbers: $x\in(-\infty,8)\cup(-2,1)$.

2016-04-16 21:30:48	harwiltz	Hi guys. I'm having trouble understanding something about divergence theorem/flux integrals. I saw a problem where I was asked to find the flux out of an ellipsoid centered at the origin with some vector field F. I don't remember the exact function, but the divergence of it was 0. However, since F had a singularity at the origin, I was told that I can replace the ellipsoid by any arbitrary shape enclosing the
2016-04-16 21:30:48	harwiltz	origin and do the flux integral. Can someone explain why I can do this?

You can order the elements of each set S_n in the usual way, and then because all of the sets are finite, you can "lay them end to end" so to speak and so you have one long sequence that covers all of the real numbers
2016-04-16 21:49:34	etotheipi	the intersection of those conditions is “there exists exactly one x in X …”

2016-04-26 10:52:08	harwiltz	Hi guys. If you have to do a SVD of a rectangular matrix, the resulting factorization can have different configurations of dimensions in the matrices. For example, my prof assigned a SVD problem on a 2x3 matrix. His answer was a factorization of (2x3)*(3x3)*(3x3). The way I did it, I got (2x2)*(2x2)*(2x3), which also gives the right dimension and the right matrix (I multiplied it using some software that I
2016-04-26 10:52:08	harwiltz	have.) Can my SVD still have the right SVD properties/can it be valid?

2016-05-15 21:50:00	harwiltz	Cale: Which textbook did you use for Real Analysis 1? 
2016-05-15 21:50:15	mathnoob	rudin was a hard read
2016-05-15 21:50:27	harwiltz	So I've heard ;)
2016-05-15 21:50:33	mathnoob	my profeesor strongly recommended Courant & John
2016-05-15 21:50:35	Cale	I actually don't recall that there was an assigned text.
2016-05-15 21:50:42	harwiltz	Oh ok, I see.
2016-05-15 21:50:43	Cale	The notes were pretty good

2016-05-15 21:51:33	Cale	There's a free book which is very measure theory focused which I found incredibly useful in my measure theory course later on, but which is intended as a very different sort of first course in real analysis
2016-05-15 21:51:35	mathnoob	harwiltz: yeah

2016-05-15 21:53:08	harwiltz	mathnoob: Hahaha thanks!
2016-05-15 21:53:12	Cale	I don't know if the early part of the book actually functions as intended, since I didn't use it for that though.
2016-05-15 21:53:24	JordiGH	Ramanujan wasn't very good at proving anything.

2016-05-15 21:53:50	Cale	It looks like it might be a bit brisk if you didn't know the things it introduces before getting on to measure theory proper.
2016-05-15 21:53:58	JordiGH	I am not sure he had the time to learn a better exposition style before he died.
2016-05-15 21:54:04	harwiltz	That Spivak book looks pretty good though. 
2016-05-15 21:54:25	harwiltz	Looks much more deep than my single variable calculus book
2016-05-15 21:54:39	Cale	Yeah, it's *very* different from the average Calculus text

2016-05-15 21:55:55	JordiGH	It's probably also the most common Scottish name possible.
2016-05-15 21:56:05	Cale	I wonder how much we were set back by Ramanujan not having the time to formulate all his magic in a way that everyone could understand :)
