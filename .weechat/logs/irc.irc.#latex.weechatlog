2016-02-14 14:53:27	kaste	in that folder there is a pdf doc, that explains what to do I think
2016-02-14 14:53:40	kaste	problem is it's in Greek and I can't read it
2016-02-14 14:53:44	kaste	but you probably will
2016-02-14 14:54:10	kaste	if that doesn't help, I personally believe you are better off with a greek ttf/otf font and xelatex lualatex
