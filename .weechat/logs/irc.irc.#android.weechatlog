2016-06-04 21:42:31	alphamule	RPC2 is a huge waste of time
2016-06-04 21:42:57	harwiltz	Hello. Is this an appropriate place to ask questions about android app development?
2016-06-04 21:43:05	alphamule	If you ignore/delete all the .BUP files (or replace them with the IFO's) except for the last bogus 1GB IFO's, it works fine.

2016-06-04 21:44:40	sivir	only bad thing with linux is graphics drivers, this one doesnt have one with own memory so no problems with changing with the intel chip and "external" gpu
2016-06-04 21:45:13	sivir	but my previous one with ati gpu 2gb I had horrible problems with battery life etc

2016-06-04 21:49:13	alphamule	LOL, not really.  The existance of this model made the others super cheap.
2016-06-04 21:49:32	Khaytsus	mAh Non-removable Li-Ion Battery?  Seriously?
2016-06-04 21:49:45	Khaytsus	Mediatek MT6735 processor..  Third world country phone?
2016-06-04 21:50:06	alphamule	Yeah, LG is joining the dark side.
2016-06-04 21:51:12	 *	alphamule never buys one with a non-removable battery
2016-06-04 21:51:18	ForTheWin	as long as the flagship stays with remov battery and no mediatek crap, i may end up getting lg next, samsung has done messed himself up
2016-06-04 21:51:30	alphamule	Vaporware anyways
2016-06-04 21:51:39	Khaytsus	No flagship in a first world country will have mediatek
