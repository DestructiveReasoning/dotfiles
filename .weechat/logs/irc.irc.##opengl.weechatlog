2016-05-09 11:55:32	harwiltz	Hey guys. I'm having trouble learning OpenGL. I've read a bunch of books and watched a lot of youtube tutorials, but every time I try I feel like I just end up copying down a bunch of code that I'll never be able to reproduce, and then I get really bored and quit. Any suggestions on how to learn and really understand all the code, so it doesn't feel like I'm just copying everything down?

2016-05-09 11:57:40	afl_ext1	harwiltz set up goals first
2016-05-09 11:57:48	afl_ext1	and be sure to learn moden opengl
2016-05-09 11:57:50	afl_ext1	modern*
2016-05-09 11:58:18	harwiltz	afl_ext1: I guess that makes sense, so I guess I can just do some really small stuff. What exactly do you mean by modern opengl?
2016-05-09 11:58:44	afl_ext1	the one with shaders and buffers, not with glbegin and things like that
2016-05-09 11:58:57	afl_ext1	more specifically > 3.3 core
2016-05-09 11:59:26	harwiltz	afl_ext1: Ok that's fine, every book I've read uses shaders and buffers
2016-05-09 11:59:32	afl_ext1	great
2016-05-09 11:59:41	afl_ext1	then set up a goal and split it into smaller problems
2016-05-09 11:59:48	harwiltz	afl_ext1: Is there anywhere I can find some beginner ideas for small projects to build?
2016-05-09 12:00:01	afl_ext1	like, at first i decided that I will try to make very simple flight simulator
2016-05-09 12:00:23	afl_ext1	you know 1 mesh terrain and 1 mesh plane and it flies
2016-05-09 12:00:27	afl_ext1	after that things gone smooth
2016-05-09 12:00:52	harwiltz	afl_ext1: That's actually a really cool idea
2016-05-09 12:00:52	afl_ext1	it looked like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgsBaHe4bKw

2016-05-09 12:02:16	harwiltz	But that looks way more complicated than anything I've ever done in opengl

2016-05-09 12:03:34	harwiltz	Yeah, but there's shadows and stuff, and it looks like you must have made a .obj parser or something
2016-05-09 12:03:41	afl_ext1	no shadows at all
2016-05-09 12:03:52	harwiltz	afl_ext1: Sorry, I meant lighting
2016-05-09 12:03:53	afl_ext1	obj is super simple
2016-05-09 12:03:56	afl_ext1	no lighting

2016-05-09 12:04:11	afl_ext1	just a function depending on height on terrain and 1 dot on model
2016-05-09 12:04:49	harwiltz	afl_ext1: But still, you had the effect of changing the color of the plane and terrain in a cool way
2016-05-09 12:05:11	afl_ext1	its just dot(normal, vec3(1,1,1)) * blue color as I remember
2016-05-09 12:05:20	afl_ext1	max(0, dot(...))
2016-05-09 12:05:49	harwiltz	Still pretty cool
2016-05-09 12:06:35	harwiltz	Well you sir have inspired me. Do you think trying something like that in OpenGL ES on an Android phone would complicate things at all?
2016-05-09 12:06:42	afl_ext1	no
2016-05-09 12:06:54	harwiltz	Ok cool. And did you have collision detection?
2016-05-09 12:07:03	afl_ext1	done with bullet physics
2016-05-09 12:07:20	afl_ext1	but its not neccesary for a start of course
2016-05-09 12:08:04	harwiltz	afl_ext1: Ok cool. Out of curiosity, how 'realistic' were the airplane dynamics? 
2016-05-09 12:08:19	afl_ext1	nothing at all XD
2016-05-09 12:08:31	harwiltz	Hahaha ok. Still looked cool though
2016-05-09 12:08:42	afl_ext1	I think the video was made when repo was on this commit: https://github.com/achlubek/vengine/tree/26f02463b36612c0ff902dc7167f2cc2c54ada74

2016-05-09 12:21:22	harwiltz	afl_ext1: Do you think OpenGL is overkill for making 2D games? I planned on using it to make a nice looking 2D game with shadows and stuff

2016-05-21 21:03:37	harwiltz	ratchetfreak: Thanks
2016-05-21 21:04:06	TheChubu	4x4 matrices are there for translation. you cant represent a 3d translation with a 3x3 matrix.
2016-05-21 21:04:15	TheChubu	its a shear in 4d if you will.
2016-05-21 21:04:25	TheChubu	but what you care about is that it looks just like a translation.
2016-05-21 21:04:37	ratchetfreak	it allows all affine transformations and projection to be represented by a 4x4 matrix
2016-05-21 21:05:15	TheChubu	ah yeah, projections, no clue how those work.
2016-05-21 21:05:20	harwiltz	I guess that makes sense. Can you help me understand the geometric meaning of the w component though? Like how do I know what to set w as for a point
2016-05-21 21:05:30	ratchetfreak	swap w and z and then projection divide
2016-05-21 21:05:50	harwiltz	So swap w and z, and then divide everything by the fourth component?
2016-05-21 21:05:53	ratchetfreak	this makes more distant object become smaller on screen
2016-05-21 21:06:00	ratchetfreak	for projection yeah
2016-05-21 21:06:20	ratchetfreak	each point should have 1 for the w component
2016-05-21 21:06:35	harwiltz	Woah now I'm lost...
2016-05-21 21:06:42	harwiltz	How is that swapping w and z?
2016-05-21 21:07:04	ratchetfreak	hold up
2016-05-21 21:07:37	ratchetfreak	at the start each point has 1 for the w component
2016-05-21 21:07:56	harwiltz	Ok, but why would the w's change?
2016-05-21 21:08:05	harwiltz	Or what do you mean by at the start?
2016-05-21 21:08:13	ratchetfreak	the input
2016-05-21 21:08:29	ratchetfreak	then after multiplying with the transform and view matrices the point is in a space where the camera is at origin and looking down the Z axis
2016-05-21 21:08:57	ratchetfreak	then you apply the projection matrix
2016-05-21 21:08:58	harwiltz	Ok, and thats when you do the perspective divide
2016-05-21 21:09:04	harwiltz	Ok, I see

2016-05-21 21:09:38	ratchetfreak	the porjection matrix isn't just swapping z and w it also includes a scale and a shift along the Z to make the result fit in the correct bound

2016-05-22 16:05:18	afl_ext	dynamic geometry is for example waves on ocean
2016-05-22 16:05:24	afl_ext	or grass on wind and so on
2016-05-22 16:05:33	Stragus	Waves on ocean should probably be done in the vertex shader though
2016-05-22 16:05:36	harwiltz	I see. So I should translate my view matrix

2016-05-22 16:17:07	harwiltz	So if I want to move my sprite, should I be translating the projection matrix or the model matrix? I'm thinking the model matrix, but then I have to compute the projection matrix each frame

2016-05-22 16:17:50	derhass_	why would you have to recompute the projection matrix?
2016-05-22 16:18:12	harwiltz	That's a good question. Probably because I don't know what I'm doing ;)

2016-05-22 16:18:58	harwiltz	Actually, my render procedure doesn't depend on the model matrix though
2016-05-22 16:19:21	Yaniel	the model (sprite or mesh) transform is in the model matrix
2016-05-22 16:20:00	Yaniel	which can be recomputed for each model every frame if things move
2016-05-22 16:20:30	harwiltz	Not the way I have it... I literally never refer to my model matrix unless the aspect ratio changes (this is an android app)
2016-05-22 16:20:45	harwiltz	So my sprite is only given access to the projection matrix
2016-05-22 16:20:49	afl_ext	i think you're doing it wrong
2016-05-22 16:21:10	harwiltz	afl_ext: That's possible... but I'm following a book
2016-05-22 16:21:34	harwiltz	Not saying you're wrong, just saying I think I may have to restart
2016-05-22 16:21:37	Yaniel	that doesn't make it right
2016-05-22 16:21:42	derhass_	if your book has model matrices depend on the aspect ratio of the viewport, do yourself a favour and throw it away
2016-05-22 16:22:26	ratchetfreak	it's the projection matrix' job to adjust for the aspect ratio
2016-05-22 16:22:40	harwiltz	derhass_: The model matrix isn't dependent on the aspect ratio, the projection matrix is. But when the aspect ratio changes I multiply the projection matrix by the model matrix
2016-05-22 16:23:10	harwiltz	So I'm saying I think I have to multiply my projection matrix by my model matrix each frame
2016-05-22 16:23:25	ratchetfreak	not that unusual
2016-05-22 16:23:33	harwiltz	Oh, ok
2016-05-22 16:23:38	derhass_	usually, you also have a view matrix inbetween
2016-05-22 16:23:46	derhass_	which often changes poer frame, too
2016-05-22 16:23:52	derhass_	*per
2016-05-22 16:24:00	harwiltz	But then how do I get my original projection matrix back? Should I be storing a temporary array?
2016-05-22 16:25:04	ratchetfreak	yeah cache it if you are going to be needing it again

2016-05-22 16:26:05	harwiltz	Although I guess it's just one 64 bit array so it isn't really a bg deal

2016-05-22 16:28:29	Stragus	We don't have the same definition of efficiency
2016-05-22 16:28:51	Yaniel	let's see... an API call with 20-40 layers of stack vs a local variable
2016-05-22 16:29:00	Yaniel	yeah the API call is definitely faster
2016-05-22 16:29:08	ratchetfreak	which may need to communicate with th eGPU

2016-05-22 16:30:08	ratchetfreak	rockets go pretty fast but it takes ages to set one up to get going

2016-05-22 16:30:35	Stragus	harwiltz, CPUs can do a crazcy amount of calculations "per frame" (as long as you aren't using Python, Javascript or such)
2016-05-22 16:30:39	Stragus	Not as crazy as GPUs though
2016-05-22 16:30:49	ratchetfreak	you have 16 milliseconds to do your stuff in
