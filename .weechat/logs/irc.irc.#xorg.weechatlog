2016-08-05 15:40:26	harwiltz	Hello all. Trying to compile my first x11 app. I'm getting a ft2build.h: No such file or directory. Any idea whats wrong?
2016-08-05 15:41:20	vktec	harwiltz: What distro?
2016-08-05 15:41:25	harwiltz	vktec: Arch
2016-08-05 15:41:46	harwiltz	I checked and found that I do have freetype installed.
2016-08-05 15:42:07	vktec	harwiltz: How are you compiling
2016-08-05 15:42:16	harwiltz	gcc *.c -lX11
2016-08-05 15:42:57	vktec	Try sticking -lfreetype on the end of that
2016-08-05 15:43:38	harwiltz	vktec: Lol. I took a shot in the dark and tried -lft2, but that probably isn't a thing ;)
2016-08-05 15:43:52	harwiltz	vktec: Just tried that though, same error
2016-08-05 15:44:20	vktec	Hmm
2016-08-05 15:44:56	harwiltz	vktec: I actually have the infinality version of freetype, do you think that matters?
2016-08-05 15:45:10	vktec	Doubt it
2016-08-05 15:45:20	vktec	Try this: gcc *.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs freetype2 x11)
2016-08-05 15:46:11	harwiltz	vktec: I think that's a fix... I'm getting a different error now but that's from my code ;)
2016-08-05 15:46:26	harwiltz	vktec: Also I'm getting lots of warnings
2016-08-05 15:46:28	vktec	:)
2016-08-05 15:46:34	harwiltz	vktec: Thanks!
2016-08-05 15:46:41	harwiltz	But what does that mean?
2016-08-05 15:47:01	vktec	It uses the tool called pkg-config to get the required options for gcc
2016-08-05 15:47:21	vktec	And then substitutes them in using bash's command substitution
2016-08-05 15:47:27	harwiltz	so if I run what's in the brackets as a command, it should tell me what to include?
2016-08-05 15:47:32	vktec	Yep
2016-08-05 15:47:41	vktec	It'll output a bunch of options
2016-08-05 15:47:54	vktec	So it's easier to just do it dynamically
2016-08-05 15:48:05	vktec	Also means it'll work across distros too
2016-08-05 15:48:07	harwiltz	Yeah... thanks so much! Never heard of that
2016-08-05 15:49:17	vktec	It's quit commonly used in Makefiles
2016-08-05 15:49:19	vktec	*quite
2016-08-05 15:49:49	harwiltz	vktec: Just put it in my makefile, now it's not working... wtf?
2016-08-05 15:50:57	vktec	Type this and paste the output here (it'll upload your Makefile and give you a link): nc termbin.com 9999 <Makefile
2016-08-05 15:51:28	harwiltz	I don't think I have nc
2016-08-05 15:52:09	harwiltz	vktec: It's not working
2016-08-05 15:52:15	harwiltz	My Makefile is very simple though:
2016-08-05 15:52:18	harwiltz	all:
2016-08-05 15:52:38	harwiltz	gcc *.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs freetype2 x11)
2016-08-05 15:52:46	harwiltz	That's it
2016-08-05 15:53:04	alanc	probably need $$ in the makefile so it passes the $ through to the shell instead of treating it as a makefile variable
2016-08-05 15:53:26	harwiltz	yup! Thanks!
2016-08-05 15:53:38	vktec	It's better to do $(shell pkg-config ...)
2016-08-05 15:53:41	vktec	fwiw
2016-08-05 15:53:50	harwiltz	Never heard of that either. Thanks!
2016-08-05 15:53:50	alanc	that works too
2016-08-05 15:54:03	alanc	well, that works for GNU make, not other makes (BSD, Solaris, etc.)
2016-08-05 15:54:28	vktec	Oh, okay
2016-08-05 15:54:35	 *	vktec has only ever used GNU make
2016-08-05 15:54:58	harwiltz	;)
2016-08-05 15:56:25	harwiltz	Stupid question... but can I not compile a C program if it doesn't have a main function?
2016-08-05 15:57:57	vktec	harwiltz: TIAS
2016-08-05 15:58:40	harwiltz	?
2016-08-05 15:58:51	vktec	Try It And See
2016-08-05 15:58:54	harwiltz	If that means try it and see, I did :)
2016-08-05 15:58:59	vktec	:)
2016-08-05 15:59:03	vktec	Does it work?
2016-08-05 15:59:06	harwiltz	Oh ok haha. Never knew that. Yup
2016-08-05 16:02:24	harwiltz	Thanks a lot guys! Guess I should get back to work.

2016-08-05 16:49:34	harwiltz	Hello again. I'm trying to compile my first x11 program, and I'm getting a warning saying "implicit declaration of function XCreateColorMap, followed by two errors: undefined reference to XCreateColorMap and XftFontOpenName. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
2016-08-05 16:52:04	alanc	implicit declaration usually means you either forgot to include a header or got the function name wrong
2016-08-05 16:52:32	alanc	in this case, you have a typo
2016-08-05 16:52:40	harwiltz	I do?
2016-08-05 16:52:54	alanc	XCreateColormap (lowercase M) is defined in /usr/include/X11/Xlib.h
2016-08-05 16:53:01	<--	anilatx (~anilatx@unaffiliated/anilatx) has quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2016-08-05 16:53:04	harwiltz	Oh wow. Thanks
2016-08-05 16:53:47	harwiltz	what about the other one? Can't find anything wrong with that, and I'm pretty sure I've included everything I need.
2016-08-05 16:53:49	alanc	grep shows XftFontOpenName is defined in /usr/include/X11/Xft/Xft.h so for that one, make sure you have #include <X11/Xft/Xft.h>
2016-08-05 16:54:03	harwiltz	alanc: I do have that
2016-08-05 16:54:39	alanc	and when you look at that file you see the function there?
2016-08-05 16:54:49	alanc	oh wait
2016-08-05 16:55:02	alanc	that wasn't implicit declaration, that was undefined reference
2016-08-05 16:55:07	harwiltz	yup
2016-08-05 16:55:21	alanc	undefined reference is not finding a library that has the function in
2016-08-05 16:55:44	alanc	Xft functions are in a separate library
2016-08-05 16:55:55	harwiltz	Oh, do I have to link it somehow?
2016-08-05 16:55:59	alanc	add "xft" to your pkg-config list
2016-08-05 16:56:08	harwiltz	Ohhhh ok. Thanks a lot
2016-08-05 16:56:08	alanc	i.e. pkg-config --cflags --libs freetype2 x11 xft
2016-08-05 16:56:33	harwiltz	Yup, worked! Thanks a lot
2016-08-05 16:57:19	harwiltz	Just one thing. In this case, I had to add xft, but how do I know to add 'xft' exactly? Why not Xft, for example?
2016-08-05 17:02:32	alanc	because the file it's looking for is named /usr/lib/pkgconfig/xft.pc
2016-08-05 17:02:46	alanc	we should document these names in the man pages or something, but I don't think we ever have
2016-08-05 17:03:14	harwiltz	Oh ok, but how did you know about xft.pc?
2016-08-05 17:03:44	alanc	from being one of the people who worked on the project to convert X to use pkg-config
2016-08-05 17:04:01	harwiltz	alanc: Oh. Hahahaha. That's cool
2016-08-05 17:04:20	alanc	as I said, we should document it so that new people can learn
2016-08-05 17:04:33	harwiltz	For more clueless people like me, is it feasible to just browse /usr/lib/pkg-config?
2016-08-05 17:04:42	alanc	probably
2016-08-05 17:04:48	harwiltz	Oh ok.
2016-08-05 17:04:54	harwiltz	Thanks a lot for the help.
2016-08-05 17:05:03	alanc	other options are finding which package delivered the library you're looking for and look at the list of files it delivers
2016-08-05 17:05:22	harwiltz	That's not a bad idea either
2016-08-05 17:05:36	alanc	or using nm on the libraries in /usr/lib to find which delivers a function, then grepping the *.pc files for that library name
2016-08-05 17:05:57	harwiltz	That's probably the quickest way actually.
2016-08-05 17:06:05	harwiltz	But I don't know what nm is
2016-08-05 17:06:18	harwiltz	Oh ok just man'd it
