2016-06-04 21:44:17	grekkos	no problem
2016-06-04 21:45:01	grekkos	that will actually run through the app, so you'd need a device connected or an emulator which isn't as fast as a robolectric test but it's closer to real user interaction and it can check ui elements have the right content and so on
2016-06-04 21:45:44	harwiltz	Hello. I'm trying to create a live wallpaper, but I'm getting a failed binder transaction error. I understand that has to do with passing too much data or something, which I believe arises from the images I'm using in the wallpaper. So I guess I should somehow store those images in the phones storage and load them from there. Can someone explain how to do that?

2016-06-04 21:47:00	Anthaas	Hypothetical here.
2016-06-04 21:47:32	Anthaas	A service needs the Activity to not change for it to be able to send the callback, right? So could/should I change the callback activity in onPause() of the original callback before it changes?

2016-06-04 21:49:49	b1ackcat	anthaas, it's been awhile since I've used services, but iirc you should set the callback while binding then remove the callback when unbinding (unbinding in onpause/stop/destroy whatever works for your use case)
2016-06-04 21:50:06	harwiltz	Hmm, actually I'm not entirely sure what's causing this failed binder transaction. If I'm doing a live wallpaper, I'm never using any Intents or Bundles. I just refer to a GLEngine. How can I bypass this error?
2016-06-04 21:50:33	Anthaas	b1ackcat, Interesting, so I can't foretell the service where it should redirect to?
2016-06-04 21:50:54	Anthaas	I guess this would be the case if my activity hasn't been created yet, but the previous activity has paused, when the service finishes.
2016-06-04 21:52:54	harwiltz	Also another weird thing is that the combined size of the images I'm using is < 1mb

2016-06-05 13:04:01	Napalm	you can avoid it easily.. but thats not the point
2016-06-05 13:04:05	liuwenhao	Is it possible to use IntelliJ UML diagrams feature in Android Studio? Or it is IntelliJ only? https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/working-with-diagrams.html
2016-06-05 13:04:06	harwiltz	And also I used this exact WatchRenderer class within an activity and it worked properly
2016-06-05 13:04:18	Napalm	can you paste yuor service.. thats the most important bit here

2016-06-05 13:06:00	Napalm	perhaps look at the plugins

2016-06-05 13:11:45	harwiltz	Do you know where?
2016-06-05 13:12:03	Napalm	GLWallpaperSurfaceView should be inside your service class

2016-06-05 13:13:13	harwiltz	Ok, cool. Thanks a lot
2016-06-05 13:13:18	Napalm	see the onCreate of your Engine.. that gives you the surfaceHolder
2016-06-05 13:13:31	Napalm	save it into a member variable
2016-06-05 13:13:49	Napalm	then have getHolder of your GLWallpaperSurfaceView return it
2016-06-05 13:13:53	harwiltz	Oh... I see
2016-06-05 13:13:54	purplex88	what is really meaning of min and max target versions? if i use the features from say 6.0 how will they be avaliable in min target say 4.2?

2016-06-05 13:21:12	purplex88	oh right makes sense now
2016-06-05 13:21:16	Napalm	thats why we have the Compat support librarys
